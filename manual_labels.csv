The owner of the store told me I wouldn‚Äôt get a refund due to ‚Äúso called food handling‚Äù. This was a dry product in its original packaging and unopened. The product had no expiry date on the package when I bought it, the receipt had no return policy whatsoever. So what gives them the right to tell me about handling?

This is a store I have seen expired palm oils on the shelf severally but the store owner had the audacity to preach to me about food handling. I want to point out the double standard and hypocrisy.

We are new in Calgary and decided to give this place a try. We ordered the poundo yam & okra (see pic of the okra), rice & ofada, and pepper soup. On arrival, there was no one at the register and we had to wait about 10minutes & it took my partner hollering and waving to get a response. I specifically asked if the ofada was the green or the red one of which the lady that attended to me answered that it was green. Lo and behold it looked more like red pepper stew. The Okra was the one that we thought was pretty poor. From what i know, okra was a ‚Äòdraw‚Äô soup but what we were served was surely not Okra. I made this known to the lady that served us that I was surprised by this. I took a couple of scoops to feed myself and my 22month old but could no longer take it. I brought it to the attention of the ladies (1 who i believe is the owner). Her response was ‚Äòso what should i do, what should i do?). To avoid confrontation, i requested to just have the assorted meat and we were ready to leave. I asked for egusi soup instead and guess she had a change of heart and provided the egusi as an exchange. This was gracious on her part. The egusi was a bit better. But i could clearly hear the owner grumbling and speaking in the kitchen about me/ the incident. The other lady said I should have ordered ogbono if I wanted draw soup. Welp! It seemed like a joke to be honest. Its just sad that as much as we try to support our own, we are met with so much disappointment and poor service. Our Nigerian food is very expensive and wished we got more value and better experience out of it. Will not be returning. Order the Okra at your own risk!",1,6/22/2023 2:35,0

On the surface, Luubann is not in an ideal neighborhood and parking is hard to find. It is such a little unassuming dining establishment that one might think it's not worth a stop.  And it's certainly not a fancy place.

We would not have normally stopped there if it wasn't because of the diet of my friend. But I am so glad we did.  The lady at the front was so kind and sweet.  We ordered a goat and a beef and we were thrilled. And to top it all off, she brought us two soups for free.

I am so glad to share this review and the five stars. We'll be back.",5,3/7/2022 21:03,1

The food is Ethiopian and Eritrean and it's very fresh seems to be made with tons of love. They play traditional music ?? ?? and cook authentic east African cuisine. I was blown away by the good service our waitress was nice attentive and the food was quickly made. Drinks were nice and professionally made their are pool tables so it's like resteraunt meets lounge. The coffee ?? ?? was really good and strong true coffie lovers will appreciate the  experience as a you recieve a near espresso like coffie on a decorative plate with burning insense. They treat you like family make you feel welcome and it's like really like a lounge. Its a laid back feel its casual and the people are nice I strongly recommend visiting them and having a few drinks and playing pool. Cool place it's very new and it'll be a nice place during summers as they have many ideas for outside dining this summer..,4,4/8/2023 22:59,1

122,Edmonton,Habesha African Market,224,4.3,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1bVlpbV9nRRAB,"Picked up a u-haul yesterday and drove it ten minutes to my old apartment, ten minutes to the new one, and ten minutes back to the store. Despite this thing being a gas guzzler, the gas gauge did not move because of how short the trip was.

The photos are time stamped and you can see that they look exactly the same at pickup and drop off. I guess I¬ím naive but I thought it was silly to stop to put $3 in on the way back but boy was I wrong.

Because I¬ím honest to a fault, I made the mistake of telling them I hadn¬ít put gas in it because it literally hadn¬ít moved. I guarantee if I hadn¬ít said anything they would not have noticed. They told me I had to take it to the gas station and put the $6 it cost me (and put me over the original amount) or they¬íd charge me $25 on top of my bill.

I truly cannot understand how eating the cost of $3 is worth losing me as a customer and getting this one star review. You can tell that it didn¬ít move because even with gas prices being the way they are $6 me over the original amount.

They told me that uhaul is the one who makes the rules but I didn¬ít realize the vehicle transmits the gas gauge to uhaul (it doesn¬ít) for a gauge that, had it moved, had a difference of of something as thin as a strand of hair. The lady at the counter went outside and took a picture that looked exactly like the picture I had taken 8 mins before and insisted that it had moved.

I swept out the back as asked and was not refunded the $25 dollars for bringing it back clean as the sign inside and of the box truck said.

I went to this place because it was the closest to my apartment and had an okay rating, but never again.

It¬ís sad because initially I had planned to do some grocery shopping here in the future ???????",1,8/24/2022 9:18,0

381,Red Deer,Flikky Market,62,4.6,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNwZ01XYjVRRRAB,"Do not recommend ordering from them online, at least until they get a better payment method. Never received order after two months and they would not answer their phone(voicemail is always full), or emails. Even after driving from Calgary to Red Deer and being promised a refund in person it took multiple more emails and weeks before I received my refund.

Their online store requires you to send a e-transfer for payment, which is a red flag but I thought a small business with good reviews would be trustworthy. Unfortunately this means there is no way to go through the bank to get your money back if they never deliver. When combined with the fact that their online store is not kept up to date with whether a product is actually in stock or not, and you can end up ordering something they don't have, and don't even know when they will ever get it. Then you're basically stuck fighting with them for a refund like I did or hoping you can trust them to eventually get the product and actually ship it to you.

They never communicated any of these issues with me until after a month of trying to reach them. The only thing I had heard from them was the week I placed my order, when I asked about my order and was told it would be delivered the next day. Three weeks later I had to drive to Red Deer to be told they never had the product and didn't know when they would get more, but they would give me a refund the next business day.

For Caucasians expecting chain restaurant service, this place isn't for you. The service is kind and functions at its own pace: its all worth it, trust me. If you get 'hangry' like me, take a quick snack before getting to the place. Sometimes they run out of a kind of meat, especially late at night: Michelin star restaurants do the same.
I recommend getting one more dish than the party size, for example: If you're 4 people sharing a platter, get 5 dishes and share them. All the options are delicious, have fun exploring.
I've been here with groups of 4 and even 11 (Drop by early and let them know you'd like to host a group, they'll let you know if they can do it and when in the evening).",5,11/19/2022 16:37,1
504,Airdrie,East Africa Restaurant,333,4.4,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4NDVibVp3EAE,"I have eaten at 50+ different Ethiopian restaurants over the years. The taste of the food is good, straight forward really. I always prefer this traditional style, not fusion or fancy, so that part of my experience was mostly fine. But I was surprised that the meat dish my son ordered was put in the middle of a vegetarian platter for 4. Despite we ordered it separately, my son was sitting at a different table. We got there when the restaurant opened and it took over an hour for the food to hit our table. We waited so long for the water we requested when we placed our order, after 45 minutes my 8 year old walked up to them to ask, she was so thirsty and patiently waiting. When they brought the water he made a passive comment about her asking for it. Also, THERE WAS NO running WATER IN THE RESTROOM TO WASH HANDS WITH. I had to go to the car to get our hand sanitizer since we are planning to eat with our hands obvs. The menu has a post-it note disclaimer on it, stating ""some menu items MIGHT cost $1-$2 dollars more per item when you get your bill"". What kind of ridiculousness is this???? When I got the bill each item was $2-$3 more! The whole experience took for ever. All in all, it ended up being over priced for how long we waited and how rude the service was. I will never go back there again. Also the hours posted on the window are different than what is on their website and what is on google. It was closed when we arrived, but we hung around trying to figure out where else to go and saw a light came on inside. They never actually turned the Open sign on in the front. If you are vegetarian and somebody else in your group orders meat, you have to be very clear that your plates are separate, in fact mention it twice because they did not do this even though my son was sitting at a different table. My son said the meat dish was cold. Some of the vegetarian selections were cold too, like the spinach, which is a hot dish. Nightmare dining experience. It was so bad, I was a bit jealous of the table that was smart enough to get up and walk out. The people who work there were listening to their devices, on high volumes too.  Disappointing all around, since the reviews were so good.",1,5/25/2023 2:38,0

I honestly am baffled that this place has this high of a rating.
We placed an order over the phone. Once we arrived, in company of two small children, the owners, a man and a woman, denied receiving any calls. They were extremely impolite: they both started screaming that we did not make a reservation. Furthermore, the owners asked us to go wait outside while the whole place was empty. When my sister tried clarifying that she had indeed made a reservation, the couple was extremely rude once again. They just kept going on and on getting out their pent-up anger.

The place itself is falling apart. The decor is non-existent, and the quality of the seating is as bad as the manners of the people who own this place.

I have yet to see such ill-mannered people.
Truly terrible. I am unsure why anyone would want to give them their money.
I guess it was our fault we decided to try this place in spite of reading reviews of people getting mistreated.

We were very happy to find a turkish restaurant close by where we were treated with respect and dignity.

To the owners - the way people treat others is a direct reflection of oneself. I'm sorry you have 0 respect for yourselves.  I am still in shock that people like you actually exist.

It took a while for everything to get rolling, but if you're not in a rush, this place is worth checking out. The people are very friendly and the dishes are very good, incredibly flavoursome: I'm salivating just thinking about this. We were two people and shared three of the injera dishes and we were utterly stuffed. Two might have been just enough come to think of it, but we went in hungry.

The price was on the high side I would say, but nothing offensive. Take note, they have no utensils here. You are forced to eat with your hands. If this bugs you, then you might want to consider takeout.",5,1/23/2020 3:49,1
524,Airdrie,East Africa Restaurant,333,4.4,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURVdjZpMTlRRRAB,"So my friends and I wanted to try out Ethiopian cuisine - and wanted to try East Africa Restaurant out. I was deeply bothered and hurt about several things that happened in the restaurant that I'll be sharing - hoping that the restaurant authorities will heed attention and hopefully make sure that it doesn't happen to another customer.

I've attached the picture below of our meal. It costed CAD$ 71 dollars. Its a subjective issue - if it feels expensive to you or not. Personally, I found it to be VERY expensive - for a 4 person meal - and for someone who seeks value for money - this was downright disappointing.

We ordered - 4 separate curries on the menu - which were full-fledged meal prices, as you can imagine from the $71 dollar bill - each meal was about 14-15ish dollar. When you order a 14-15 dollar plate - you expect it to be filling - but when you see the meal doesn't even reflect the order you placed, you'll be sad. We ordered, a chicken curry, lamb curry, beef and mixed vegetable. But all we got in the mush was beef gravy and little of lentil, one drumstick chicken AND one egg (did not find any lamb, felt like one full curry over-crowded by beef curry). The food, amidst the quantity and not reflecting 4 dishes - was good in taste. If it did not cost as much as it did, may be, we would have let go of this issue of disappointment entirely.

However, the reason, why I took the time out to actually write a review and give 1 star because of how we were treated. When we finished our dinner (still starving) - and went to pay, we were asked 'how was the food'. We courteously replied, the food was great, but the quantity compared to the price seemed very unfair. What the owner replied was 'that's the right amount for price you are paying' - it ticked me off. My friend told him, 'No, there are other places, where we could have eaten well in full with the amount we just paid' and he straight up said, ""I don't care what you think, I don't care what other people charge you, this is my restaurant"". This guy was full-on debating mode and not willing to listen to anything at all. I knew the conversation was no where going to any logical alley - so we stopped it. And walked out. On our way out, we even heard him mumbling more stuff about us that we didn't care to listen.

Moral: If you have a restaurant, and serving your 'amazing culinary skills', you should be open to accepting criticism and learn to hear them out before making your customers feel undervalued. An air of arrogance never did anyone good. We should all be treating each other with respect and courtesy no matter what the situation. Its the customers at the end of the day what makes restaurants thrive. If you don't know how to deal with customers and their opinions, then may be you shouldn't serve. If I paid my hard earned money for some 'OVERPRICED portions' of food, then the last thing I expect is to go home still hungry and raging over how mistreated my friends and I were.",1,9/9/2019 18:32,0
525,Airdrie,East Africa Restaurant,333,4.4,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPNEs2LXh3RRAB,"Horrible experience. I should have read the negative stars instead before picking this place. They seem to have a pattern and rip people off with their orders by combining them into 1 plate.

We ordered a vegetarian platter and a beef platter and they combined both...When I tell you the portions were insanely small... we were under the impression that our other order was coming out. Tiniest portions ever. We thought maybe a second plate was coming since we were 3.

They charged us for both plates as if they brought us both orders, the appropriate portions and injeras.

So for a tiny scoop of beef cubes added onto the vegetarian platter they charged us the whole price of the beef platter of $17.99 (price of the beef platter)¬Ö What platter? It was a half a scoop of beef that was added to the tiny vegetarian platter.

What a rip off. Shocked they did that so shamelessly. I told the lady and her attitude and response was shocking. I left no tip. Undeserving. Never coming back.

Paid 40$ for supposedly 2 platters, one Vegetarian and one Beef.

They brought us 1 platter with not enough food. It looked like a personal order and not a combination platter. When I tell you I am never coming back and making sure everyone I know that wanted to try this place will not be going. You don't do that to people and their customer service is complete garbage.

I was standing there for a minute and a patron who was exiting tapped her card for me. Embarrassing.
