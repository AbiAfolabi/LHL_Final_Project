1,Edmonton,Africart Plus More,5.0,5.0,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1bXVlUDN3RRAB,"We shoppers need to think deeply and shop creatively. It is worth your money, time and effort shopping at Africart  located in  Bonnie Doon mall. This store has African artifacts, carvings, drums, colourful ,durable clothing, purses, jewelry, much more, sky is the limit. The trend is buy materials made in factories not by hand. Provenance is an artwork's history of ownership. Information about the provenance of an individual work of art sheds light on its historical, social, and economic context as well as its critical fortunes through time.Creative thinkers and makers provide their communities with joy, interaction, and inspiration, but they also give thoughtful critique to our political, economic, and social systems  pushing communities to engage thoughtfully and make steps toward social progress.-This truth--is from an article. We society need to shop creatively to buy art work from shops like Africart where we get valuable information, quality service and our money's worth of priceless items. Art cannot be measured by its price but measured as follows: Art reflects cultural values, beliefs and identity and helps to preserve the many different communities that make up our world. I bought hand carved turtles, elephants, and beautiful and colorful dresses. I highly recommend it is worth your time to visit this unique store and receive excellent customer service from knowledgeable and caring staff.",5.0,8/18/2022 16:14

5,Edmonton,Habesha African Market,224.0,4.3,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQyaXBUNnVRRRAB,Thier is a resteraunt at this same location not easy to find not sure of the name but staff will gladly guide you to it. The food is Ethiopian and Eritrean and it's very fresh seems to be made with tons of love. They play traditional music ?? ?? and cook authentic east African cuisine. I was blown away by the good service our waitress was nice attentive and the food was quickly made. Drinks were nice and professionally made their are pool tables so it's like resteraunt meets lounge. The coffee ?? ?? was really good and strong true coffie lovers will appreciate the  experience as a you recieve a near espresso like coffie on a decorative plate with burning insense. They treat you like family make you feel welcome and it's like really like a lounge. Its a laid back feel its casual and the people are nice I strongly recommend visiting them and having a few drinks and playing pool. Cool place it's very new and it'll be a nice place during summers as they have many ideas for outside dining this summer..,4.0,4/8/2023 22:59

17,Edmonton,Habesha African Market,224.0,4.3,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUR1bVlpbV9nRRAB,"Picked up a u-haul yesterday and drove it ten minutes to my old apartment, ten minutes to the new one, and ten minutes back to the store. Despite this thing being a gas guzzler, the gas gauge did not move because of how short the trip was.

The photos are time stamped and you can see that they look exactly the same at pickup and drop off. I guess Im naive but I thought it was silly to stop to put $3 in on the way back but boy was I wrong.

Because Im honest to a fault, I made the mistake of telling them I hadnt put gas in it because it literally hadnt moved. I guarantee if I hadnt said anything they would not have noticed. They told me I had to take it to the gas station and put the $6 it cost me (and put me over the original amount) or theyd charge me $25 on top of my bill.

I truly cannot understand how eating the cost of $3 is worth losing me as a customer and getting this one star review. You can tell that it didnt move because even with gas prices being the way they are $6 me over the original amount.

They told me that uhaul is the one who makes the rules but I didnt realize the vehicle transmits the gas gauge to uhaul (it doesnt) for a gauge that, had it moved, had a difference of of something as thin as a strand of hair. The lady at the counter went outside and took a picture that looked exactly like the picture I had taken 8 mins before and insisted that it had moved.

I swept out the back as asked and was not refunded the $25 dollars for bringing it back clean as the sign inside and of the box truck said.

I went to this place because it was the closest to my apartment and had an okay rating, but never again.

Its sad because initially I had planned to do some grocery shopping here in the future ???????",1.0,8/24/2022 9:18

276,Red Deer,Flikky Market,62.0,4.6,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNwZ01XYjVRRRAB,"Do not recommend ordering from them online, at least until they get a better payment method. Never received order after two months and they would not answer their phone(voicemail is always full), or emails. Even after driving from Calgary to Red Deer and being promised a refund in person it took multiple more emails and weeks before I received my refund.

Their online store requires you to send a e-transfer for payment, which is a red flag but I thought a small business with good reviews would be trustworthy. Unfortunately this means there is no way to go through the bank to get your money back if they never deliver. When combined with the fact that their online store is not kept up to date with whether a product is actually in stock or not, and you can end up ordering something they don't have, and don't even know when they will ever get it. Then you're basically stuck fighting with them for a refund like I did or hoping you can trust them to eventually get the product and actually ship it to you.

They never communicated any of these issues with me until after a month of trying to reach them. The only thing I had heard from them was the week I placed my order, when I asked about my order and was told it would be delivered the next day. Three weeks later I had to drive to Red Deer to be told they never had the product and didn't know when they would get more, but they would give me a refund the next business day. It took another month of trying to reach them to get it.",1.0,8/21/2023 21:24

For Caucasians expecting chain restaurant service, this place isn't for you. The service is kind and functions at its own pace: its all worth it, trust me. If you get 'hangry' like me, take a quick snack before getting to the place. Sometimes they run out of a kind of meat, especially late at night: Michelin star restaurants do the same.
I recommend getting one more dish than the party size, for example: If you're 4 people sharing a platter, get 5 dishes and share them. All the options are delicious, have fun exploring.

Prices are very fair for the amount of food and the quality, much more so than other Ethiopian cuisine restaurant in the city.

I suggest looking up the menu on the website and making a reservation and ordering ahead of time so that they can start preparing the food ahead of time. These dishes are full of flavour and spices and require time to prepare and simmer.
It can take some time for the food to arrive, sometimes over an hour but you expect it and know it is worth the reward at the end!

399,Airdrie,East Africa Restaurant,333.0,4.4,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4NDVibVp3EAE,"I have eaten at 50+ different Ethiopian restaurants over the years. The taste of the food is good, straight forward really. I always prefer this traditional style, not fusion or fancy, so that part of my experience was mostly fine. But I was surprised that the meat dish my son ordered was put in the middle of a vegetarian platter for 4. Despite we ordered it separately, my son was sitting at a different table. We got there when the restaurant opened and it took over an hour for the food to hit our table. We waited so long for the water we requested when we placed our order, after 45 minutes my 8 year old walked up to them to ask, she was so thirsty and patiently waiting. When they brought the water he made a passive comment about her asking for it. Also, THERE WAS NO running WATER IN THE RESTROOM TO WASH HANDS WITH. I had to go to the car to get our hand sanitizer since we are planning to eat with our hands obvs. The menu has a post-it note disclaimer on it, stating ""some menu items MIGHT cost $1-$2 dollars more per item when you get your bill"". What kind of ridiculousness is this???? When I got the bill each item was $2-$3 more! The whole experience took for ever. All in all, it ended up being over priced for how long we waited and how rude the service was. I will never go back there again. Also the hours posted on the window are different than what is on their website and what is on google. It was closed when we arrived, but we hung around trying to figure out where else to go and saw a light came on inside. They never actually turned the Open sign on in the front. If you are vegetarian and somebody else in your group orders meat, you have to be very clear that your plates are separate, in fact mention it twice because they did not do this even though my son was sitting at a different table. My son said the meat dish was cold. Some of the vegetarian selections were cold too, like the spinach, which is a hot dish. Nightmare dining experience. It was so bad, I was a bit jealous of the table that was smart enough to get up and walk out. The people who work there were listening to their devices, on high volumes too.  Disappointing all around, since the reviews were so good.",1.0,5/25/2023 2:38

I honestly am baffled that this place has this high of a rating.
We placed an order over the phone. Once we arrived, in company of two small children, the owners, a man and a woman, denied receiving any calls. They were extremely impolite: they both started screaming that we did not make a reservation. Furthermore, the owners asked us to go wait outside while the whole place was empty. When my sister tried clarifying that she had indeed made a reservation, the couple was extremely rude once again. They just kept going on and on getting out their pent-up anger.

The place itself is falling apart. The decor is non-existent, and the quality of the seating is as bad as the manners of the people who own this place.

I have yet to see such ill-mannered people.
Truly terrible. I am unsure why anyone would want to give them their money.
I guess it was our fault we decided to try this place in spite of reading reviews of people getting mistreated.

We were very happy to find a turkish restaurant close by where we were treated with respect and dignity.

To the owners - the way people treat others is a direct reflection of oneself. I'm sorry you have 0 respect for yourselves.  I am still in shock that people like you actually exist.

I can't speak for authenticity but it is absolutely delicious! And the injera is so soft and Fluffy and so easy to digest! Because it is run by only two people, it can take some time for your food to come out (I believe it was around 30 minutes) because I believe they make every dish to order. But it is so worth it!

By phone to let them know of my tardiness.
When I finally arrived the owner was extremely rude to me. He said I was late and couldnt get my order. He proceeded to sell it to someone else who had just showed up and not even made an order ahead of time.
Granted I was late but it was beyond my circumstances. I feel like he could have still accommodated me as I drove all the way from south shore to pick up this order.

407,Airdrie,East Africa Restaurant,333.0,4.4,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQybm9DdnpRRRAB,"My fiancé and I are literally addicted to this place. We go every two weeks to get our Ethiopian fix.

Dining here literally feels like you're dining at a family members house; they are beyond welcoming, make us feel comfortable, and prepare their meals with love and passion that you can taste.

The restaurants ambience is very low-key, nestled along the Sherbrooke strip in the heart of NDG. There are several occasions when they sometimes don't have what we'd like on the menu, as they're a very small operation, and I can only assume that materials run out fast, especially given how tasty things are, but they always make up for it by making us custom dishes and sides for us, which we always love.

We have a running gag about going - ""they're not going to serve you what you want, but what you need"" - and this motto, the quality of their food, and the fact that it feels like eating with family makes us come back religiously every two weeks to have their amazing food.

We have been to several Ethipoian restaurants across Canada, and this is the only place that we consistently go out of our way to go to on a consistent basis; it's not sophisticated, has modern seating, etc, but it doesn't need those things, because the food is that good.

Something to note however that other reviewers have mentioned as well; you need patience to eat here. All the food and dishes are made to order, and sometimes it can take quiet long to come out, but trust me, it's worth it. In addition, the fact that two grown adults can eat handsomely for 30$, including a tip, seems like a dying phenomena right now. For the cost alone this place is incredible.

I'd you're reading this are you haven't already made your way to their restaurant and gotten a dual order of 18 and 20/21, this review hasn't done their rest enough justice! Go support a small local business, and enjoy!

FYI - they also accommodate BYOW as well, so if you're so inclined to pair the injera with a nice bottle of wine, that's a nice option as well!

The place consists of 4-5 tables at most and even then struggles to maintain service when the tables are full. It took a while for everything to get rolling, but if you're not in a rush, this place is worth checking out. The people are very friendly and the dishes are very good, incredibly flavoursome: I'm salivating just thinking about this. We were two people and shared three of the injera dishes and we were utterly stuffed. Two might have been just enough come to think of it, but we went in hungry.

The price was on the high side I would say, but nothing offensive. Take note, they have no utensils here. You are forced to eat with your hands. If this bugs you, then you might want to consider takeout.",5.0,1/23/2020 3:49
418,Airdrie,East Africa Restaurant,333.0,4.4,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURnM0pDTlFBEAE,"As is their culture's custom, there are no utensils.
You use the crepe the food is sitting on, to pinch a portion of food, and then try and get it to your mouth, before having it fall into your lap. ;(
We chose veggies with chicken and beef.

Best seat in the house is the window seat.
Very small, with some atmosphere.
Food took time, but, was worth the wait.
However....***
1. I think cutting the rolled crepe into smaller manageable portions and not having to tear uneven rolls would help. At least for me.
2. If you are using hands, then perhaps a bowl of hot water or wet naps and definitely more napkins would help solve that. ""We were assigned one napkin each.""
3. Water only.... so bring you own drinks.
4. Where menu?  The Menu is on the wall... so I photographed it and attached it here somewhere.  Be advised, French only.
5. There is a washroom downstairs. Should be updated.
6. I guess you could always ask for a fork and knife.
However...
I am still rating it high-ish, only,  only because of the quality of the food and the novelty of the whole experience. All in all, - Very much fun. ...and good luck getting the window seat!",4.0,8/11/2018 14:29
419,Airdrie,East Africa Restaurant,333.0,4.4,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURVdjZpMTlRRRAB,"So my friends and I wanted to try out Ethiopian cuisine - and wanted to try East Africa Restaurant out. I was deeply bothered and hurt about several things that happened in the restaurant that I'll be sharing - hoping that the restaurant authorities will heed attention and hopefully make sure that it doesn't happen to another customer.

I've attached the picture below of our meal. It costed CAD$ 71 dollars. Its a subjective issue - if it feels expensive to you or not. Personally, I found it to be VERY expensive - for a 4 person meal - and for someone who seeks value for money - this was downright disappointing.

We ordered - 4 separate curries on the menu - which were full-fledged meal prices, as you can imagine from the $71 dollar bill - each meal was about 14-15ish dollar. When you order a 14-15 dollar plate - you expect it to be filling - but when you see the meal doesn't even reflect the order you placed, you'll be sad. We ordered, a chicken curry, lamb curry, beef and mixed vegetable. But all we got in the mush was beef gravy and little of lentil, one drumstick chicken AND one egg (did not find any lamb, felt like one full curry over-crowded by beef curry). The food, amidst the quantity and not reflecting 4 dishes - was good in taste. If it did not cost as much as it did, may be, we would have let go of this issue of disappointment entirely.

However, the reason, why I took the time out to actually write a review and give 1 star because of how we were treated. When we finished our dinner (still starving) - and went to pay, we were asked 'how was the food'. We courteously replied, the food was great, but the quantity compared to the price seemed very unfair. What the owner replied was 'that's the right amount for price you are paying' - it ticked me off. My friend told him, 'No, there are other places, where we could have eaten well in full with the amount we just paid' and he straight up said, ""I don't care what you think, I don't care what other people charge you, this is my restaurant"". This guy was full-on debating mode and not willing to listen to anything at all. I knew the conversation was no where going to any logical alley - so we stopped it. And walked out. On our way out, we even heard him mumbling more stuff about us that we didn't care to listen.

Moral: If you have a restaurant, and serving your 'amazing culinary skills', you should be open to accepting criticism and learn to hear them out before making your customers feel undervalued. An air of arrogance never did anyone good. We should all be treating each other with respect and courtesy no matter what the situation. Its the customers at the end of the day what makes restaurants thrive. If you don't know how to deal with customers and their opinions, then may be you shouldn't serve. If I paid my hard earned money for some 'OVERPRICED portions' of food, then the last thing I expect is to go home still hungry and raging over how mistreated my friends and I were.",1.0,9/9/2019 18:32
420,Airdrie,East Africa Restaurant,333.0,4.4,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPNEs2LXh3RRAB,"Horrible experience. I should have read the negative stars instead before picking this place. They seem to have a pattern and rip people off with their orders by combining them into 1 plate.

We ordered a vegetarian platter and a beef platter and they combined both...When I tell you the portions were insanely small... we were under the impression that our other order was coming out. Tiniest portions ever. We thought maybe a second plate was coming since we were 3.

They charged us for both plates as if they brought us both orders, the appropriate portions and injeras.

So for a tiny scoop of beef cubes added onto the vegetarian platter they charged us the whole price of the beef platter of $17.99 (price of the beef platter) What platter? It was a half a scoop of beef that was added to the tiny vegetarian platter.

What a rip off. Shocked they did that so shamelessly. I told the lady and her attitude and response was shocking. I left no tip. Undeserving. Never coming back.

Paid 40$ for supposedly 2 platters, one Vegetarian and one Beef.

They brought us 1 platter with not enough food. It looked like a personal order and not a combination platter. When I tell you I am never coming back and making sure everyone I know that wanted to try this place will not be going. You don't do that to people and their customer service is complete garbage.

Come with patience as the cook makes everything to order and the wait could be a long one if 9 people suddenly arrive all at the same time. It's a bring-your-own-wine so when you have wine and good company, the wait is easily forgettable especially once the delicious food finally arrives.

We ordered 4 different meals, each costing above $16 per meal. But the quantity we got given 4 meals and the price was extremely disappointing and not filling at all. I understand that they serve the meals together into one plate, but the quantity of food is totally
NOT worth it given the price.

We respectfully told the owner during payment that even though the food was good, it is very small amount in quantity - to which his reply was really rude, and said that is what we should get for the price we are paying. We told him
that other similar restaurants we went to would give a lot more amount for the price, to
which his reply was - he doesn't care what ofher restaurants charge and the portion they serve, because at this place this is what it is supposed to be.

It felt bad being treat this way. We paid a LOT for 4 meals, almost $70 in total, but hardly got a portion of meal equivalent to that amount.

This restaurant could be a best example of mismanagement and poor service. They let people come in and order and then undergo a long long waiting time for that food. And to top it all, no one brings WATER to your table unless you ask for it. Last time we had to wait for about 2 and a half hours for the same. The customers were again and again looking at the counter in the hope of seeing some food coming out of the kitchen. This is so embarrassing and torturous on the customer's part because firstly, they are paying for the food and then, when some people were inquiring the owner about the same, he was very arrogant and was behaving as if he was doing some kind of favor or charity on them. Sometimes, the people who had ordered, an hour after you, were getting served before you. The food is good but the price one has to pay in terms of waiting for it is exorbitant. We destroyed our entire Friday evening, just waiting for food. They should keep more people or atleast do some prep work before letting people in and pay more attention to the customers.

688,Edmonton,Bete Africa Ethiopian Restaurant and Bar,222.0,4.7,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2anFYMmxnRRAB,"This place is absolutely fantastic. The service is so kind. If you love Ethiopian food, you will not be disappointed. The serving sizes are big, if you see a big price, that's because you will be feeding alot of people. Ask about serving sizes of you aren't sure, the staff are happy to talk to you. When we came here with our family it was my first restaurant experience out of the hospital and it was so warm and inviting.

If you love meat usually and are disappointed by the amount of veggies on the menu, trust me, these veggies pack so much flavor you will not be missing the meat and this is coming from someone who almost always has to correct that thought in my head when eating Ethiopian. Don't be scared of the veggie stews. It's not by any means a side of steamed veggies beside your lamb. No no no. You will very likely prefer these veggie stews over the meats. Not to say the meats are bad, they're just very filling, and you will want to eat and share with your party and finish your plater while having a good time, veggie stew options sit a little nicer for that and the meat can be a nice little treat.

You can order as much of the bread as you would like. Don't stress take your time, share.

I definitely recommend the coffee afterwards. It's a thick Ethiopian coffee that they roast in house and we felt so lucky to see our (it honestly feels deminutive to call her a waitress since she was so involved) roast the beans from green, bring out the grounds, tell us about the origins of even the coffee set.

She asked us if we were sensitive to scent and if we would like some incense that helps settle the stomach. I really appreciate this because I am sensitive to some scents but traditional incense, unless it involves pine or cedar, is fine with me (as far as I know) so we had coffee and smelled the incense as our (Barista/waitress/historian) puts up with me trying to pin down what kind of incense it is because it smells so nice.

She saw I was making an effort and she gave me some. It was an incredible evening and we had leftovers to share. I hope you do well with your business and you live up to your name.",5.0,9/29/2021 15:13

691,Edmonton,Bete Africa Ethiopian Restaurant and Bar,222.0,4.7,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURRX1lMc0RnEAE,"***AMAZING food, slower service***

The food we had at Bete Africa was incredibly delicious; hands-down some of the best Ethiopian food in Edmonton.  The decor was beautiful, and the owners were very pleasant, and offered lots of advice, since a couple people in our group of 6 had never had Ethiopian food before; My one issue was that our food took nearly an hour to arrive, to the point we were about to ask for it to just be packed up for takeaway, they brought it to the table.  Drink orders took a while as well.

Everything was delicious!  We ordered the All-in-One Special (which might be why things took so long, but a heads-up would have been helpful when we ordered).  This is a huge combo platter with a little bit of everything and LOTS of injera.  We came fairly close to crushing it between the 6 of us, but it easily could feed 8-10 people.  It was also INCREDIBLY affordable, coming to $20 each, including tip.

I can't even begin to express how delicious this food is, but if you're coming here during the week for lunch, maybe book some extra time beyond an hour to account for service.  I definitely will recommend this to others, and will be back myself, but will make sure it's on a day I'm not in a hurry.

Thank you so much for a wonderful experience. I will definitely be back!",5.0,9/13/2018 16:38

We were greeted by the host and seated right away. The host brought us soups (on the house) and the menus. He then left and came back with 3 jugs (2 juices and 1 water - again, on the house) and asked if we had any questions. They were very accommodating in explaining what each item on the menu was.

We ordered chicken mashkaki, salmon, lamb shank, tilapia, and sides of bread, rice, and vegetables. The food quality was great, there was a good amount of flavour and the spices were not over done. For dessert, we had ice cream and tea. The tea was a bit sweet for our taste as we enjoy black tea.

While eating, the owner came out and made sure we were satisfied. He also shared his backstory which was refreshing to hear about. Overall, the service and their hospitality were great.

As for pricing, we were very surprised to see a $66 bill for 4 people dining out with a complete meal. You cant find fast food for that kind of price that we enjoyed so much food for.

5/5 would recommend this place.",5.0,9/20/2021 1:59

The soup was  light, simple and very tasty. It really stimulates your sense of appetite and prepare you for the main course.  The lamb was well done and served with a sauce of perfect consistency and spices and aroma. Specially prepared basmati rice was served on the side . Also, as an additional side, you are given the option of a  jug of lemon or mango juice, as well as fruit, in my case a well ripened tasty banana. It also had a specially prepared hot sauce for individual liking. Moreover, it has free  three hours street parking right in front of the restaurant or on any street in the neighborhood. The appetizer,  juice and fruit were included in the price of the menu which I think is a good friendly jesture. Moreover,  I found staff very friendly and cheerful.  You get alot for your money.

Food was delicious, we ordered barbeque chicken with rice as well as the beef muscle with rice. These also came with the delicious chicken soup which they served as soon as we sat down. It was definitely way more than we could finish and our server gave us some complementary chapati bread which was very delicious. I really really liked their spicy green hot sauce which they gave me extra to take home lol. They also brought us a mango cheesecake with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and another type of cake for my husband with some ice cream which was also very nice and generous of them and it was very delicious.

Very good food, plenty of beverages, and if you ask nicely, they have a special cheesecake banana dessert which you can't buy anywhere else. My top favorite entrees are the lamb shank, the breaded sugar chicken, and the salmon. The rice is very flavorful, and I liked the spaghetti too. I go out once in a while for very nice food. But what makes Rayyan special is that it's the any occasion restaurant. It's affordable to go every day, and has a nice area for more formal occasions. I've held family dinners here with my grandma and uncle's family. And I've also brought co-workers and managers.

He brought me out a complimentary bowl of soup that was delicious. What a nice thing to do. My food was ready in ten minutes. I paid my bill and he inquired in a really welcoming way how I had heard of the restaurant so I told him it was just by chance. He spoke to me in a way that made me feel really welcomed at the restaurant. I got home and had the food and it was awesome. The rice was perfect and the beef and vegetables came in a nice gravy that mixed with the rice was just the kind of home cooked taste that I needed in my food.

938,Edmonton,Rayyan Restaurant,495.0,4.9,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHaDZEbkp3EAE,"Having been kept by Covid from eating out as we used to, my wife and I got to do a lot of home cooking. We pretty much cut out going to restaurants. Because of that we became really picky the few times we went to a restaurant, or we bought take-out from one. We didnt want to eat in, or have take-out from, a so-so restaurant the few time we did either. One place, out of the very few, that has become our go-to restaurant for take-out, is Rayyan Restaurant, which is located in downtown Edmonton on 106 Avenue, just off 101 Street. The restaurant caters mostly Somali food. Were not new to restaurant Somali food. We used to help ourselves to it a lot but went off it for quite sometime. Then, not too too long ago, we happened to be driving along 101 Street across 106 Avenue when we spotted Rayyan Restaurant, which describes itself as serving East African food. We said, A new East African restaurant. I bet they serve Somali food. Lets try it out! We did and found the food to be better than much other Somali food we had had in the past  a variety of tasty, dishes in big portions served in a fast but friendly and professional manner. The owner, Noor, is engaging with a welcoming smile. He keeps a hands-on involvement on various tasks in the restaurants but still finds time for brief pleasant exchanges with customers. The restaurant operates 7 am to 10 pm, which means they must have lots of customers to be confident enough to be open for so many hours daily. Their confidence must come from their good food. We have tried mostly camel, lamb (shoulder and shank), beef, flavored rice and spaghetti, and chapati (flat bread); and all those dishes have been sumptuous. Rayyan also serves goat and chicken, which we havent try but plan to. They also serve breakfast, which we havent tried but we may just one day, out of curiosity. All in all, Rayyan is a Somali food restaurant I would recommend without hesitation to any one with a love for or curious about African food. Rayyan may be an excellent place for one to begin their African culinary journey.",5.0,12/12/2021 3:00

The restaurant was quite large with modern fixtures mixed with some authentic African decor. The menu was multiple pages and had lots to offer all dietary restrictions but does cater more to those who like meat. The girlfriend ordered lamb tibs while I ordered the shiro wot, and both were accompanied by a side of ingera. The lamb dish spicy, savoury and filling. The shiro wot (chickpea stew) came out piping hot in a bowl and it had a savoury but sweet flavour. Its hard to explain but absolutely delicious. The pictures attached seem like the portions are small due to the large plate of ingera but the girlfriend packed leftovers to go, while I finished my dish while completely satisfied.

I'm a regular customer of this store and I travel to buy my groceries there all the way from Oshawa because I buy things in bulk. I previously purchased a box of chicken which wasn't cut the way I would like them cut and ever since I have my own reservation and would like them cut right in front of me. On this day, the guy refused and was adamant that I either take the pre-cut chicken or nothing, I tried to be understanding by telling him to show me a piece and then I would decide if I'm okay with it and he said I can open the box myself and check it if I like. I found this so disrespectful! He was actually getting into a heated argument with me and I thought it's best I leave the store. The owners of this store have a great personality but I believe it's high time they started looking into their employees attitude as well because if not guided, they might bring down their business!

He is rude every-time and I cant stand there to exchange words with him only Cos hes an elderly man, i hope he works on his ego issues this year Cos he is definitely doing a kind of job that humbles people but hes out there trying to show/prove himself to people when theyre not even looking down on him in the first place, if he cannot do the job just give the opportunity to someone else.

If I may suggest,  acknowledge your customers, having a store in Canada means you are serving customers who are Nigerians and non Nigerians. You are not the only African store in Scarborough. People have options and would like to support you but when you don't acknowledge customers,  you keep them waiting like they have nothing to  do with their time then expect no one to support you.
All I ask is that you do better with your customer service because you do have a lot of potential as a business.  Also with the renovations going on in your store try to keep it tidy. It's a mess and a health and safety hazard.
I also understand that it's a husband and wife that own the store, but this is where as business owners you hire a staff to help customers or multitask.  When I'm going home after a long day at work, I want to quickly grab the few things that I need,  pay and go home.  I don't want to stand there for 20minutes, not being acknowledged or cared for.

The young lady who took our order spoke English quite well, which was honestly somewhat unexpected. I can imagine that most of the regular clientele is not Anglophone, so the effort on her part was greatly appreciated by both of us.
What this place lacks in atmosphere(it is the definition of a hole in the wall, imo) is more than made up for by the food, but their dinnerware and presentation is also lovely. We will be back, probably with friends. These ladies really deserve more business!",5.0,5/29/2017 0:02

The server was very friendly and let me know what they dont have in stock right from the start. He also explained the different types of food in great detail. In terms of food, I had their daily soup, the lamb shank with KK instead of rice/pasta (Xanid), mango juice, and samosa. The soup and juice being complimentary items is similar to other African restaurants that I have been to, but its still a nice surprise. All the food tasted really good. The soup had a lot of spice and flavour and I had multiple bowls. The juice and samosa were quite nice as well. The lamb shank with KK is definitely worth trying: It had nice cuts of tender and flavourful lamb, the KK was good on its own, and they complimented each other together.",5.0,3/12/2022 20:38

1704,Edmonton,Zuhur Restaurant,374.0,4.6,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNoOWJHeUp3EAE,"I recently visited Zuhur Restaurant and had an amazing dining experience! They offer Somali cuisine in a casual, 'Mom's Kitchen' kind of atmosphere. Cutlery is optional here. If you've enjoyed casual African food before though, you won't be surprised by that. If you're put-off by this kind of casual experience you'll be missing an amazing meal but, at least you'll be leaving seats open for the rest of us.

I had the lamb and rice, and I have to say, it was one of the best meals I've had in a long time. The flavours were well balanced and the portion size was generous. Service was quick and plenty of Mango juice and tea were on hand too, of course.

African food is best served spicy but Zuhur caters to sensitive taste buds too. For those who prefer milder dishes, they can feed you as well. If you like spice as much as I do though, grab an extra shot of hot sauce, that stuff is awesome

I can cheerfully recommend Zuhur Restaurant to anyone looking for a delicious and satisfying meal. If you're a fan of African - Somali cuisine and, you appreciate home cooking served in the casual way that home style food is best enjoyed, this is a great place to go. The staff here was casual and friendly and everyone can enjoy the food regardless of their spice tolerance. Trust me, you won't be disappointed!",4.0,2/18/2023 21:38

The soup is not good, and the salads are alright, I wouldn't order them if I had to pay separately for these two items.
This place was a value proposition for the rice and goat meat at $13 a year before, now costs $17 plus charges if you use a debit card. Given its location, the small portions of goat meat, this is not a value proposition anymore, one feels like we are paying 10$ for the large portion of rice.

I literally just wrote it down in the notes, but your going to call me back with attitude and question me about my note I had left. Who intimidates their customers like this, so you do not want feedback? They then had the audacity to say they delivered my food when they did not. I then contacted skip to tell them about my missing delivery, the driver continued to lie and say he delivered right to my hands. This is a complete lie and a complete waste of my time and money.

No major quams about this location outside of wishing that they would put on a movie, nature channel or something more interesting then cp24.  I (female) will note however, the staff are very rarely at reception as they tend to do tasks in pairs (if they are doing tasks that is).  I very seldom interact with the staff and cant even remember a time Ive even gotten a welcoming smile or greeting in my years of visiting this location.

Today I forgot my water bottle and as I exited the Women's washroom, no shocker,  both employees on duty were together heading towards the utility room. So I kindly interrupted one to advise that I had to go back for my water but as I just tapped my card I would need her to let me back in. She gave me a dismissive head nod (might have uttered  an okay) and I went about my way to my car. To no surprise, she wasnt at the desk to let me back in. I was standing there for a minute and a patron who was exiting tapped her card for me. Embarrassing. When I arrived inside, the same staff was casually pushing the garbage bin with her other coworker as if she had forgotten that I had literally just asked for her assistance.

Gym gets busy after 4pm so be wary but even around then you can get a good workout.

Cleanliness is pretty good I always see staff going around cleaning things. I have no complaints about the staff mainly because I almost never interact with them, but they seem ok. The gym is always open 24hrs including holidays.

People in the gym are from most age groups (depending on the time of day). Mostly guys during peak hours (I'm a guy but if you're a girl this might matter).

Black Card gives you
Free Hydro massage
Free Tanning
Free Massage chair
Access to other Fit4Life
Open house last Thurs of every month for friends and family.

If you're looking for personal training or an experience, this is not it as their lack of experience and staff don't really know what they're doing in terms of knowledge on themselves or even when they give advice. I've gone here for a couple of years and even during covid and the management isn't great, the staff was mediocre at best as they went to clean up but more times than not, the gym overall was a mess.

I've also had a poor experience when it came to a dude with roid rage as he threw a plate at me and management took a over a week to address and kick him out. This showed me how much they really care but then again, $5 biweekly for a membership is what you get right? Who cares about the members.

I haven't had an issue with deadlifting heavyweights so I'm going to assume that it's fine.
