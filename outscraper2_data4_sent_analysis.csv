Africart Plus More,They have a wide variety of unique and interesting products. The owners are very personable and well-versed on what seems to be every article they have there. They are definitely one of the best priced shops for authentic African textiles and clothing. They have donated to community projects & charities annually and including Autism Edmonton through 5 Artists 1 Love!
Africart Plus More,"We shoppers need to think deeply and shop creatively. It is worth your money, time and effort shopping at Africart  located in  Bonnie Doon mall. This store has African artifacts, carvings, drums, colourful ,durable clothing, purses, jewelry, much more, sky is the limit. The trend is buy materials made in factories not by hand. Provenance is an artwork's history of ownership. Information about the provenance of an individual work of art sheds light on its historical, social, and economic context as well as its critical fortunes through time.Creative thinkers and makers provide their communities with joy, interaction, and inspiration, but they also give thoughtful critique to our political, economic, and social systems  pushing communities to engage thoughtfully and make steps toward social progress.-This truth--is from an article. We society need to shop creatively to buy art work from shops like Africart where we get valuable information, quality service and our money's worth of priceless items. Art cannot be measured by its price but measured as follows: Art reflects cultural values, beliefs and identity and helps to preserve the many different communities that make up our world. I bought hand carved turtles, elephants, and beautiful and colorful dresses. I highly recommend it is worth your time to visit this unique store and receive excellent customer service from knowledgeable and caring staff."
Africart Plus More,My favourite store in Bonnie Doon. Have visited several times in the last few years and the lady owner somehow always remembers my wife and I. Very friendly and great customer service!
Africart Plus More,Wonderful customer service. Felt like a part of the family. Would visit many more times if I lived here.
Africart Plus More,Great selection and friendly customer service!
Habesha African Market,Thier is a resteraunt at this same location not easy to find not sure of the name but staff will gladly guide you to it. The food is Ethiopian and Eritrean and it's very fresh seems to be made with tons of love. They play traditional music ?? ?? and cook authentic east African cuisine. I was blown away by the good service our waitress was nice attentive and the food was quickly made. Drinks were nice and professionally made their are pool tables so it's like resteraunt meets lounge. The coffee ?? ?? was really good and strong true coffie lovers will appreciate the  experience as a you recieve a near espresso like coffie on a decorative plate with burning insense. They treat you like family make you feel welcome and it's like really like a lounge. Its a laid back feel its casual and the people are nice I strongly recommend visiting them and having a few drinks and playing pool. Cool place it's very new and it'll be a nice place during summers as they have many ideas for outside dining this summer..
Habesha African Market,"Great place to shop but make sure you check the expiry dates. The produce ranges from super fresh to questionable. Staff is super friendly and eager to assist. If you don't see what your looking for, just ask... some things aren't where you'd expect to find them. Their signature Habesha Ethiopian coffee, whole bean or custom grind is simply exquisite. A must try.
Habesha African Market ia a fresh food oasis in a food desert and a great place to buy a mango."
Habesha African Market,This store is very good customer service is great and I easily found what I wanted Also they are no longer a U-haul drop-off/pick-up location so dont go there it was very recent either this month or last month
Habesha African Market,It was a great place to shop if you need habesha stuff. There is nothing that you can not find. The staff were great and friendly. The owner as well. All in all that place is enough to make you feel like that you are in one of market place in Addis.
Habesha African Market,"Good customer service. Welcoming you warmly. Overall, it's a good place for groceries shopping"
Habesha African Market,Received my Business Cards from here as they are an access point. Their service is excellent and products are bountiful.
Habesha African Market,"They have different African goods but it's not organized there, not easy to find price"
Habesha African Market,The owner doesn't have any respect for his employees. Shame on him the way he treats them.
Habesha African Market,Friendly staff. Good priced meat and vegetables. Lots of hair products
Habesha African Market,I dropped off a UPS return today and the lady who helped me was very courteous and helpful. She knew exactly what I needed before I even walked up to the till. I was very impressed with her.
Habesha African Market,"Awesome staff, very large variety of most things that anyone would buy at large grocery store yet conveniently within walking distance of the ice district and Kingsway. I am really impressed with the low prices."
Habesha African Market,"A great family oriented shopping store. A great experience when you are in a special place despite the name of the African shop, but without limits for everyone indeed.  That charm makes me come back again and again. Thank you"
Habesha African Market,"Picked up a u-haul yesterday and drove it ten minutes to my old apartment, ten minutes to the new one, and ten minutes back to the store. Despite this thing being a gas guzzler, the gas gauge did not move because of how short the trip was.

The photos are time stamped and you can see that they look exactly the same at pickup and drop off. I guess Im naive but I thought it was silly to stop to put $3 in on the way back but boy was I wrong.

Because Im honest to a fault, I made the mistake of telling them I hadnt put gas in it because it literally hadnt moved. I guarantee if I hadnt said anything they would not have noticed. They told me I had to take it to the gas station and put the $6 it cost me (and put me over the original amount) or theyd charge me $25 on top of my bill.

I truly cannot understand how eating the cost of $3 is worth losing me as a customer and getting this one star review. You can tell that it didnt move because even with gas prices being the way they are $6 me over the original amount.

They told me that uhaul is the one who makes the rules but I didnt realize the vehicle transmits the gas gauge to uhaul (it doesnt) for a gauge that, had it moved, had a difference of of something as thin as a strand of hair. The lady at the counter went outside and took a picture that looked exactly like the picture I had taken 8 mins before and insisted that it had moved.

I swept out the back as asked and was not refunded the $25 dollars for bringing it back clean as the sign inside and of the box truck said.

I went to this place because it was the closest to my apartment and had an okay rating, but never again.

Its sad because initially I had planned to do some grocery shopping here in the future ???????"
Habesha African Market,"Always very well stocked, great prices and such friendly staff. I love hitting up this store for my needs. Thank you guys for your hard work!!!"
Habesha African Market,"above all, do not drop off your truck with them, incompetents. I dropped off the truck 1 day in advance, he charged my scammers 2 more days and then he said he had to call customer service, I had trouble speaking English and the service was unreachable."
Habesha African Market,"Friendly devoted owners that make you feel like a VIP! Great selection, variety store, acceptable prices. Things could be a bit neater and prices displayed better. Efforts are definitely noticed, they're doing they're best to meet needs so clutter can be ignored to support a local business that cares"
Habesha African Market,Super friendly staff! Awesome product choice with the BEST prices! Not to mention their bread is usually fresh from a local bakery!! Amazing coffee thats the best price around. The best little hidden gem
Habesha African Market,Very disappointing when picking up my U-Haul truck today and only being told that the dolly that I PAID to reserve is that they do NOT even have one-- I called one week ahead specifically asking this store how I go about reserving a dolly and was advised by them to go on the official website for booking. Thanks for making my moving day with almost 20 boxes a great one guys.
Habesha African Market,I am here for renting a uhaul. Even though it's in downtown. They proivde good service. They are always nice.
Habesha African Market,It was ok. The customer service wasn't very apretiated concidering I was there for Uhaul and they Gave me a truck that was dirty and never fixed my mileage and didn't even hear me when I asked if they had a mini Usb charger just assumed I said I phone. I felt like I was annoying them
Habesha African Market,"Excellent service, prices & atmosphere! Old fashioned charm in the heart of Edmonton, where you can find everything you need without the hassles of the modern department store madness!

- Fresh meat, prepared with pride daily
- Well stocked shelves
- Courteous, friendly staff"
Habesha African Market,"It was Saturday, but there was only one girl working and by the time she was finished with us (picking up a U-Haul) there were SIXZ people waiting!

Our deposit also had increased and my hubby was concerned but she made sure to give her contact info in case there was a problem, we could contact her and she would look into it!

But, she couldnt leave the store, so we were in our own to locate then inspect the truck....if there had been more staff, they would have been AWESOME to deal with..."
Habesha African Market,"Just got a truck rental, but the staff were friendly and as fast & efficient as they can be using uhaul's system."
Habesha African Market,This place is very inviting and clean with great selection. Yassin the meat cutter is awesome!
Habesha African Market,"Don't ever go here for Uhaul.
We had a reservation... showed them the reservation number and told us that it's not their issue, and the truck got transferred else where but didn't know where...
We move today and are now stuck...

Great customer service ??"
Habesha African Market,Beautiful place to shop and enjoy
Habesha African Market,"Very friendly staff, clearance shelf is worth my stopping in at least 5times a week, convenient for me since circle k is way to expensive.."
Habesha African Market,"Had to pick up a package here - lady at the counter was nice, had a wonderful time despite some struggles between me and the package tracking. Very nice little market."
Habesha African Market,"Came to buy cigarettes and was really to find fresh fruits priced cheap.

Love coming to this place to to try new things.  The staff is super friendly especially now they have cooked food to try."
Habesha African Market,"A very fine lovely ?? lady ?? served me well there, rented a Uhaul & this gorgeous ?? lady helped me out, I say this in a good way??, with respect ?????"
Habesha African Market,"Herbs and veggies look old and almost rotting. Prices are higher than superstore. Selection is no better than a superstore. Came here looking for some African spices, but honestly their selection is simply no better than the international aisle of the superstore. Poor quality groceries and higher price make this a ripoff especially if you are on a budget."
Habesha African Market,This is where me and my fiance get most of our groceries. They're staff is extremely friendly and helpful. Large range of products. If you happen to be in the area then it's a must stop by!
Habesha African Market,Great variety and price for African spices. Staff was very friendly and helpful!
Habesha African Market,"You can buy fresh, frozen and dry/canned goods here. The service is friendly and willing to address any questions/concerns.
An essential part of the McDougall community."
Habesha African Market,"I had a great experience. The staff were very helpful, prices affordable and I got Everything I wanted. They've got a new customer and I'll gladly spread the word."
Habesha African Market,"They have some pretty neat stuff here, the staff are ways friendly, and jts where I have to pick up my UPS packages."
Habesha African Market,Find what I was looking for. Little bit expensive
Habesha African Market,"Don't bother coming here for  Uhaul, they tell you that all the trucks are reserved and then when you reserve one for this location 5 minutes after leaving the store they tell you its been given to the person in line in front of you"
Habesha African Market,"OK the owner is nice but cashier ( short girl ) can be rude  and no proper communications , i will see if things change the next time i visit the store :)
professionalism and proper approach is great asset to have for any business ."
Habesha African Market,Really love this store. Really brings the taste of Africa to Canada. Very nostalgic. Please bring back Pronutro
Habesha African Market,Great store!
Habesha African Market,"I like the fact there's a small super market in this area, glad I ventured in one day. But watch the best before dates on what you buy."
Habesha African Market,Bright and clean. Easy to pick out what you need. Good place.
Habesha African Market,"Attention to the owner:  Please watch a lady whos in the counter, she will destroy your business reputation and shes in poor hygiene. She dropped the one doughnut and she put it back in the shelf to sell. So disgusting, i never purchased anything on here again!"
Habesha African Market,There is so much great grocery variety. A bit more pricey. But close to home.

Best of Africa,Very friendly owner and staff. Store feels like home. We were welcomed to the city with free bread and a plate of egusi soup(quite big and delicious). Glad we found a permanent African store for our home. It is indeed the Best of Africa
Best of Africa,Awesome place to buy almost everything  Nigerian food stuff. Owner is very friendly and always ready to go out of her way to satisfy her customers. Has been our African market for years now and we are liking every single visit.
Best of Africa,Typical African store. Friendly store owner. But it was not really worth an hour and a half drive. Things that I bought doesn't taste like it tasted back home. Not sure how legit these products are... Won't visit it again.
Best of Africa,"O wow! The ""Best of Africa"" is my favorite; the owner of this place and her salesperson are just the best ?? for ""Best of Africa"". Just go there, test and see, then you can come and thank me later ???."
Best of Africa,"Good selection of African goods! Stock up on your pounded yam, malt, and so much more!! Parking is at the back if you cant find any spots at the front."
Best of Africa,I cant say enough good things about this place. The owner was friendly and helpful. I saved a lot by buying bulk which you dont get from other African store. Will definitely be back next time Im in town
Best of Africa,Great African ingredients. The meat is well worth the money because you won't find that quality at Safeway or any other major grocery store. I was happy to know that the meat comes from the owners farm not far away. Super friendly owner. I tried a bag with goat with bone and skin. The stew came out delicious and I can't speak highly enough of the meat. Will be back very soon.
Best of Africa,"For all
Your African foods just go there"
Best of Africa,"Very nice store owner, clean and quiet. Not a bad place to go"
Best of Africa,"The major factor in this store is the super friendly owner of this store. She usually go out of her way to satisfy her customers. You feel really at home in this store and there are variety of African products in this store.
Great service and good customer service in this store.... Love it....."
Best of Africa,"Terrible place to shop at. The owner(woman) is very impolite and some of their products are FAKE.
Save your life, DO NOT BUY PALM OIL FROM HERE,DON'T DO IT. It's actually not palm oil in those bottles, I can bet it's a mixture of chemicals that smoke and smell so bad as soon as u pour it into a hot pot. It also doesn't taste like palm oil. IT'S NOT ABOUT THE MONEY BUT A LIFE. SAVE UR LIFE AND DON'T PURCHASE PALM OIL FROM THERE."
Best of Africa,"Knowledgeable staff, had the Red Snapper fish I was looking for. Had to go to another store for fresh Yam and green banana.  Would be nice if they carried fresh vegetables."
Best of Africa,Open the time you indicate only and in front of the store. Wasted money making a trip to and from the store.
Best of Africa,She is always very helpful and she specializes in bulk meat items which we find is cheaper compared to buying in smaller quantities.

Genesis Exotic Market,"If you are an African and you miss home or want to get a taste of home, this is the place to shop.
Owners are so welcoming and always helpful in finding whatever one wants to buy.

So the lady that run the store asked us what were looking for.. so I responded the usual were just browsing and she just stood there look at us like were gonna steal or break stuff. I asked her about the wigs she rudely responded  I can help you with the wigs, if your surely gonna buy how will I know details if your not gonna give me a simple info. I saw the milk brand that I wanted to buy but since she was so rude and make us feel uncomfortable we left this store right away. There product was really amazing except the staff, Not friendly and extremely RUDE!"
Genesis Exotic Market,"Theyre best place to get your African food stuffs, native clothings and other African accessories. Guess what?

Flikky Market,"Do not recommend ordering from them online, at least until they get a better payment method. Never received order after two months and they would not answer their phone(voicemail is always full), or emails. Even after driving from Calgary to Red Deer and being promised a refund in person it took multiple more emails and weeks before I received my refund.

Their online store requires you to send a e-transfer for payment, which is a red flag but I thought a small business with good reviews would be trustworthy. Unfortunately this means there is no way to go through the bank to get your money back if they never deliver. When combined with the fact that their online store is not kept up to date with whether a product is actually in stock or not, and you can end up ordering something they don't have, and don't even know when they will ever get it. Then you're basically stuck fighting with them for a refund like I did or hoping you can trust them to eventually get the product and actually ship it to you.

They never communicated any of these issues with me until after a month of trying to reach them. The only thing I had heard from them was the week I placed my order, when I asked about my order and was told it would be delivered the next day. Three weeks later I had to drive to Red Deer to be told they never had the product and didn't know when they would get more, but they would give me a refund the next business day. It took another month of trying to reach them to get it."
Flikky Market,"Good place to shop for variety of produce. Good people, their prices are very reasonable, some even cheaper than Calgary. I will always come to Flikky buy my international foods."

Flikky Market,Owner E likes to scam. Watch out as your products may be stolen goods.
Flikky Market,I love going here for my packages of hair. Always in stock which is fabulous. Theyre always willing to help or answer any questions I might have. When I braid my hair I always make a point of going in to showing her. When people ask where I get my hair I say Flikky. But they also ask who does it?  I say I do the braids myself. Keep it up Flikky African Market.
Flikky Market,"An amazing place to buy tropical African and Caribbean foods.

The owner is the most friendly person you can ever meet. She always greets her customers warmly and is very helpful when or if you need anything.

I love going here to get my food ingredients."
Flikky Market,"Expensive, but nice place to get Caribbean food stuffs and not have to travel all the way to Edmonton. They also sell hair and skin care products. The owner of the shop is very friendly and pleasant!"

The South African Store,"If youre looking for special freaking things, give me the shot youre not gonna regret it

Love this little store that sells food and snacks you dont see often in supermarkets. This beef biltong is so good, its addictive! Im never eating those commercially sold beef jerky anymore!"
The South African Store,"If your looking for some South African grocery, I think you've found the place. This place has an assortment of unique products that you likely aren't going to find elsewhere.  Only 2 aisles and really 2 fridges, this place is small. The owner seems pretty nice. The beef jerky (biltong) is interesting. Uniquely African. Haven't had anything like it before."
The South African Store,"Lovely selection of South African groceries. A nice little piece of home, away from home. Love the owners, always friendly and helpful!"
The South African Store,"Love this little store that sells food and snacks you dont see often in supermarkets. This beef biltong is so good, its addictive! Im never eating those commercially sold beef jerky anymore!"
The South African Store,Very bad attitude of the stafftold me to leave since I was talking too much lol
The South African Store,Very interesting store - now I'm making an observation as a non South African native. But they have so many interesting products and brands which I assume is popular there. I also loved that many people came and went and made jokes with the lady behind the counter - seems like a real friendly atmosphere.
The South African Store,The best place to find Stoney Ginger Beer!
The South African Store,Absolutely love how close they are to the city! They always have a good variety of the things i miss from back in SA!
The South African Store,"How amazing is this that you can get great quality South African products locally. They have sourced out the best stuff and have really friendly staff. As a non-South African, I was so impressed with the products here that I have had to come back regularly to keep trying new things."
The South African Store,"As a South African living in Canada, I appreciate this place. It's so good to get a taste of home once in a while. I visit this store a couple of times a month and love it."
The South African Store,"We traveled to SA a few years and got hooked to a few snacks and chocolates there. This place has limited options, but great to be able to find some of those items. Price is higher than what we paid in SA, but that's ok since we're not doing the long and expensive trip."
The South African Store,Good svc and Alex was pleasantly helpful
The South African Store,"Amazing service! The gentlemam who worked here was friendly and helpful! An all around good experience! Plus I got South African treats, and you can never go wrong there!"
The South African Store,Great store lots of South African goodies and groceries that are just unable to find anywhere else. Lots of parking and the staff is always helpful and pleasant.  Wish they had other meat options other than beef for their biltong. But over all great SA grocery.
The South African Store,Interesting things they carry and the biltong is awesome. They even have the Cadbury flake! Hope they can sustain as they are speciality and life is hard for everyone Covid.
The South African Store,"I was sent an expired product. I called to ask for a refund or to be sent a new product and the owner proceeded to yell at me on the phone, hung up on me and then disconnected his phone. I would not recommend this business at all! I was extremely calm and polite and I have no idea why the owner was so rude and defensive. I was honestly completely shocked that someone can run a business in this manner and get so aggressive over a $5 bottle of sauce!"
The South African Store,I put 5 stars becoz if you put a lower one google pushes the review . Anyways I ordered $136 worth of products from this store and I am missing an item which I called the store and the rude baboon that answered the phone told i was bothering them . Anyways the item was paid but is not on my receipt.  I am missing ina parmann bbq spice .Non africans should sell african food stuff . You are rude and I am disputing the whole charge with my credit card company
The South African Store,Pleasant place to shop.  Very helpful.
The South African Store,Walking into this shop I was reminded of the empty shelves I saw in Zimbabwe about a decade ago. No offence but these guys need to have a store that is fully stacked with products. Maybe they are under economic sanctions like the aforementioned country
The South African Store,Nice variety. Owner is a very nice guy.

The South African Store,"The two owners are amazing so pleasant...The snacks are fresh, all the sweets from SA...Easily spend 50 bucks there"
The South African Store,This is a African Market that's owned by a white man who's not African and or Caribbean and knows absolutely nothing about our culture or our foods. Do not support this fake African market ??. I asked for plantain and he had no idea what that is.

The South African Store,Excellent boerewors and biltong. A nice selection of SA's classic brands.
The South African Store,Wonderful biltong.  Alex and Zoe I regard highly for their high integrity and selfless caring for others.
The South African Store,Pleasant little speciality store. But they illegally refuse to take credit cards below a certain amount - debit only for small purchases

East Africa Restaurant,Cozy restaurant with a sitting at the family table vibe. Ordered take out this time but will have to sit-in next time! Ye Begg Alicha & Ye Begg Tibbs were yummy ?? Cant wait to be back & try more dishes ??
East Africa Restaurant,"This Restaurant is wonderful and the owners are very kind. I give them 5 stars because the food is simply delicious and I have no issue with the service system.
For Caucasians expecting chain restaurant service, this place isn't for you. The service is kind and functions at its own pace: its all worth it, trust me. If you get 'hangry' like me, take a quick snack before getting to the place. Sometimes they run out of a kind of meat, especially late at night: Michelin star restaurants do the same.
I recommend getting one more dish than the party size, for example: If you're 4 people sharing a platter, get 5 dishes and share them. All the options are delicious, have fun exploring.
I've been here with groups of 4 and even 11 (Drop by early and let them know you'd like to host a group, they'll let you know if they can do it and when in the evening)."
East Africa Restaurant,"The place looks a little beat up but it is honestly the best Ethiopian in Montreal! The elderly couple that own the restaurant is adorable, they are very accommodating and kind. The food is clearly home cooked and perfectly spicy (for my liking)! Truly worth a detour or two ??"
East Africa Restaurant,"My favorite Ethiopian restaurant in Montreal. They make homemade traditional Ethiopian food, the dishes are served in a large plate, ideal to share with friends or family!

Prices are very fair for the amount of food and the quality, much more so than other Ethiopian cuisine restaurant in the city.

I suggest looking up the menu on the website and making a reservation and ordering ahead of time so that they can start preparing the food ahead of time. These dishes are full of flavour and spices and require time to prepare and simmer.
It can take some time for the food to arrive, sometimes over an hour but you expect it and know it is worth the reward at the end!

I'm so happy to have found this restaurant, my family and I always leave with a full belly and a huge smile!"
East Africa Restaurant,"I have eaten at 50+ different Ethiopian restaurants over the years. The taste of the food is good, straight forward really. I always prefer this traditional style, not fusion or fancy, so that part of my experience was mostly fine. But I was surprised that the meat dish my son ordered was put in the middle of a vegetarian platter for 4. Despite we ordered it separately, my son was sitting at a different table. We got there when the restaurant opened and it took over an hour for the food to hit our table. We waited so long for the water we requested when we placed our order, after 45 minutes my 8 year old walked up to them to ask, she was so thirsty and patiently waiting. When they brought the water he made a passive comment about her asking for it. Also, THERE WAS NO running WATER IN THE RESTROOM TO WASH HANDS WITH. I had to go to the car to get our hand sanitizer since we are planning to eat with our hands obvs. The menu has a post-it note disclaimer on it, stating ""some menu items MIGHT cost $1-$2 dollars more per item when you get your bill"". What kind of ridiculousness is this???? When I got the bill each item was $2-$3 more! The whole experience took for ever. All in all, it ended up being over priced for how long we waited and how rude the service was. I will never go back there again. Also the hours posted on the window are different than what is on their website and what is on google. It was closed when we arrived, but we hung around trying to figure out where else to go and saw a light came on inside. They never actually turned the Open sign on in the front. If you are vegetarian and somebody else in your group orders meat, you have to be very clear that your plates are separate, in fact mention it twice because they did not do this even though my son was sitting at a different table. My son said the meat dish was cold. Some of the vegetarian selections were cold too, like the spinach, which is a hot dish. Nightmare dining experience. It was so bad, I was a bit jealous of the table that was smart enough to get up and walk out. The people who work there were listening to their devices, on high volumes too.  Disappointing all around, since the reviews were so good."
East Africa Restaurant,"This is by far the best Ethiopian restaurant I have ever been. As someone who eats Ethiopian food on a daily basis I find this restaurant serving the best food.
I went there with a friend and we were the first people to order and it was a bit late and I wondered why they took so long but when I looked only to find out that they seem to prepare the food once they open which is the best thing to do and I really admired it and I didnt mind that it took a while, and after testing the food it was worth waiting it was delicious, the enjera ( bread) the sauce everything was sooo perfect. And their service was great I didnt get his name there was a nice man with a lady.
If anyone wants to eat and enjoy Ethiopian Eritrean food its the best place to dine! ?? 5 ??"
East Africa Restaurant,"Truly terrible people.
I honestly am baffled that this place has this high of a rating.
We placed an order over the phone. Once we arrived, in company of two small children, the owners, a man and a woman, denied receiving any calls. They were extremely impolite: they both started screaming that we did not make a reservation. Furthermore, the owners asked us to go wait outside while the whole place was empty. When my sister tried clarifying that she had indeed made a reservation, the couple was extremely rude once again. They just kept going on and on getting out their pent-up anger.

The place itself is falling apart. The decor is non-existent, and the quality of the seating is as bad as the manners of the people who own this place.

I have yet to see such ill-mannered people.
Truly terrible. I am unsure why anyone would want to give them their money.
I guess it was our fault we decided to try this place in spite of reading reviews of people getting mistreated.

We were very happy to find a turkish restaurant close by where we were treated with respect and dignity.

To the owners - the way people treat others is a direct reflection of oneself. I'm sorry you have 0 respect for yourselves.  I am still in shock that people like you actually exist.

To anyone wanting to try this place out, good luck!"
East Africa Restaurant,"Run by a sweet couple and when we entered all the tables were reserved so the place was full by the end of the night (also it was a Tuesday night). We ordered the two lamb dishes and the Mixed vegetarian and it was So GOOD! There are not many places I would comfortably recommend, but this one is definitely where it's at. I can't speak for authenticity but it is absolutely delicious! And the injera is so soft and Fluffy and so easy to digest! Because it is run by only two people, it can take some time for your food to come out (I believe it was around 30 minutes) because I believe they make every dish to order. But it is so worth it! Just to keep in mind that they do not serve alcohol so bring your own wine if you want to drink! I hope you can give this place a chance!"
East Africa Restaurant,"One of our favourite places to eat when we're visiting Montreal! If you're up for an authentic experience and amazing food with a bit of a wait for this lovely mom and pop shop, you're in for a treat."
East Africa Restaurant,Food was good a lot of the menu was not available. Server seems uninvested in customer experience.
East Africa Restaurant,"I was very disappointed in the customer service!
I called a day before to inquire about ordering injera and was told that in order to do so you call a day before so they can make the injera for you. So I proceeded to make my order for the next day!
Unfortunately I couldnt make it on time for my pick up, but it was impossible joining them
By phone to let them know of my tardiness.
When I finally arrived the owner was extremely rude to me. He said I was late and couldnt get my order. He proceeded to sell it to someone else who had just showed up and not even made an order ahead of time.
Granted I was late but it was beyond my circumstances. I feel like he could have still accommodated me as I drove all the way from south shore to pick up this order. But instead he just spoke to me very rudely and didnt even try to understand. Thats what I call horrible customer service. Never again!

If you want to get quality service and be respected as a customer I recommend queen Sheba restaurant instead!"
East Africa Restaurant,"The decor is simple but the food is amazing. To avoid waiting too much, call and reserve and choose your plates in advance. No pricy at all."
East Africa Restaurant,"My fiancé and I are literally addicted to this place. We go every two weeks to get our Ethiopian fix.

Dining here literally feels like you're dining at a family members house; they are beyond welcoming, make us feel comfortable, and prepare their meals with love and passion that you can taste.

The restaurants ambience is very low-key, nestled along the Sherbrooke strip in the heart of NDG. There are several occasions when they sometimes don't have what we'd like on the menu, as they're a very small operation, and I can only assume that materials run out fast, especially given how tasty things are, but they always make up for it by making us custom dishes and sides for us, which we always love.

We have a running gag about going - ""they're not going to serve you what you want, but what you need"" - and this motto, the quality of their food, and the fact that it feels like eating with family makes us come back religiously every two weeks to have their amazing food.

We have been to several Ethipoian restaurants across Canada, and this is the only place that we consistently go out of our way to go to on a consistent basis; it's not sophisticated, has modern seating, etc, but it doesn't need those things, because the food is that good.

Something to note however that other reviewers have mentioned as well; you need patience to eat here. All the food and dishes are made to order, and sometimes it can take quiet long to come out, but trust me, it's worth it. In addition, the fact that two grown adults can eat handsomely for 30$, including a tip, seems like a dying phenomena right now. For the cost alone this place is incredible.

I'd you're reading this are you haven't already made your way to their restaurant and gotten a dual order of 18 and 20/21, this review hasn't done their rest enough justice! Go support a small local business, and enjoy!

FYI - they also accommodate BYOW as well, so if you're so inclined to pair the injera with a nice bottle of wine, that's a nice option as well!

Enjoy!"
East Africa Restaurant,"The best Ethiopian food in Montreal, in my opinion. Delicious spices, very fresh, perfectly prepared. Very relaxed atmosphere."
East Africa Restaurant,"Still the best Ethiopian restaurant in MTL, even my fav when compared to Paris. Thé place is owned by two wonderful human beings Who will make you feel like home. Highly recommend!"
East Africa Restaurant,"Best Ethiopian food in town.  We're vegan so we always get the vegan combo.  Soooo delicious.   Be prepared to wait though.  If you're patient and are okay with waiting (our family always brings cards and stuff to entertain- haha), you're in for a treat."
East Africa Restaurant,"My new favourite restaurant! I tried Ethiopian food only recently and fell in love with it, since then I tried all of the restaurants in Montreal that serve it and East Africa Restaurant is by far the best because it is the most flavourful. It is also seemingly the most authentic. I could eat this food everyday!"
East Africa Restaurant,"The food was awesome! It doesnt taste like anything I ate before, so many rich flavors et textures. I think its a family owned restaurant and the vibe is heart warming. Staff were really nice and so kind, i definitly wil lcome back"
East Africa Restaurant,"Delicious food prepared by two of the loveliest people you could ever hope to meet. The beef, the lamb, the fish, and of course the veg were all fabulous. Anything else I might add would be superfluous."
East Africa Restaurant,"We came here prepared to wait and, indeed it took us 90 minutes to be served. However, the food was amazingly good! We were impressed!

Their menu has affordable prices, vegan options and you may bring your own liquor.

We highly recommend it! It is really worth the waiting!"
East Africa Restaurant,best Ethiopian food ever!! and the prices are cheaper than other restaurants in town! definitely recommend
East Africa Restaurant,"My friends and I had been talking about going to eat here for a while, and this restaurant did not disappoint! The food was absolutely delicious and far exceeded our expectations. That staff was also very kind and welcoming. We will definitely be returning!"
East Africa Restaurant,"Very interesting restaurant. The place consists of 4-5 tables at most and even then struggles to maintain service when the tables are full. It took a while for everything to get rolling, but if you're not in a rush, this place is worth checking out. The people are very friendly and the dishes are very good, incredibly flavoursome: I'm salivating just thinking about this. We were two people and shared three of the injera dishes and we were utterly stuffed. Two might have been just enough come to think of it, but we went in hungry.

The price was on the high side I would say, but nothing offensive. Take note, they have no utensils here. You are forced to eat with your hands. If this bugs you, then you might want to consider takeout."
East Africa Restaurant,"As is their culture's custom, there are no utensils.
You use the crepe the food is sitting on, to pinch a portion of food, and then try and get it to your mouth, before having it fall into your lap. ;(
We chose veggies with chicken and beef.

Best seat in the house is the window seat.
Very small, with some atmosphere.
Food took time, but, was worth the wait.
However....***
1. I think cutting the rolled crepe into smaller manageable portions and not having to tear uneven rolls would help. At least for me.
2. If you are using hands, then perhaps a bowl of hot water or wet naps and definitely more napkins would help solve that. ""We were assigned one napkin each.""
3. Water only.... so bring you own drinks.
4. Where menu?  The Menu is on the wall... so I photographed it and attached it here somewhere.  Be advised, French only.
5. There is a washroom downstairs. Should be updated.
6. I guess you could always ask for a fork and knife.
However...
I am still rating it high-ish, only,  only because of the quality of the food and the novelty of the whole experience. All in all, - Very much fun. ...and good luck getting the window seat!"
East Africa Restaurant,"So my friends and I wanted to try out Ethiopian cuisine - and wanted to try East Africa Restaurant out. I was deeply bothered and hurt about several things that happened in the restaurant that I'll be sharing - hoping that the restaurant authorities will heed attention and hopefully make sure that it doesn't happen to another customer.

I've attached the picture below of our meal. It costed CAD$ 71 dollars. Its a subjective issue - if it feels expensive to you or not. Personally, I found it to be VERY expensive - for a 4 person meal - and for someone who seeks value for money - this was downright disappointing.

We ordered - 4 separate curries on the menu - which were full-fledged meal prices, as you can imagine from the $71 dollar bill - each meal was about 14-15ish dollar. When you order a 14-15 dollar plate - you expect it to be filling - but when you see the meal doesn't even reflect the order you placed, you'll be sad. We ordered, a chicken curry, lamb curry, beef and mixed vegetable. But all we got in the mush was beef gravy and little of lentil, one drumstick chicken AND one egg (did not find any lamb, felt like one full curry over-crowded by beef curry). The food, amidst the quantity and not reflecting 4 dishes - was good in taste. If it did not cost as much as it did, may be, we would have let go of this issue of disappointment entirely.

However, the reason, why I took the time out to actually write a review and give 1 star because of how we were treated. When we finished our dinner (still starving) - and went to pay, we were asked 'how was the food'. We courteously replied, the food was great, but the quantity compared to the price seemed very unfair. What the owner replied was 'that's the right amount for price you are paying' - it ticked me off. My friend told him, 'No, there are other places, where we could have eaten well in full with the amount we just paid' and he straight up said, ""I don't care what you think, I don't care what other people charge you, this is my restaurant"". This guy was full-on debating mode and not willing to listen to anything at all. I knew the conversation was no where going to any logical alley - so we stopped it. And walked out. On our way out, we even heard him mumbling more stuff about us that we didn't care to listen.

Moral: If you have a restaurant, and serving your 'amazing culinary skills', you should be open to accepting criticism and learn to hear them out before making your customers feel undervalued. An air of arrogance never did anyone good. We should all be treating each other with respect and courtesy no matter what the situation. Its the customers at the end of the day what makes restaurants thrive. If you don't know how to deal with customers and their opinions, then may be you shouldn't serve. If I paid my hard earned money for some 'OVERPRICED portions' of food, then the last thing I expect is to go home still hungry and raging over how mistreated my friends and I were."
East Africa Restaurant,"Horrible experience. I should have read the negative stars instead before picking this place. They seem to have a pattern and rip people off with their orders by combining them into 1 plate.

We ordered a vegetarian platter and a beef platter and they combined both...When I tell you the portions were insanely small... we were under the impression that our other order was coming out. Tiniest portions ever. We thought maybe a second plate was coming since we were 3.

They charged us for both plates as if they brought us both orders, the appropriate portions and injeras.

So for a tiny scoop of beef cubes added onto the vegetarian platter they charged us the whole price of the beef platter of $17.99 (price of the beef platter) What platter? It was a half a scoop of beef that was added to the tiny vegetarian platter.

What a rip off. Shocked they did that so shamelessly. I told the lady and her attitude and response was shocking. I left no tip. Undeserving. Never coming back.

Paid 40$ for supposedly 2 platters, one Vegetarian and one Beef.

They brought us 1 platter with not enough food. It looked like a personal order and not a combination platter. When I tell you I am never coming back and making sure everyone I know that wanted to try this place will not be going. You don't do that to people and their customer service is complete garbage. Shame on them."
East Africa Restaurant,"The service is long , it took us more than an hour to get our food. But if you are patient enough, the food is absolutely incredible. Way better than the ""Nil Bleu""."
East Africa Restaurant,"We were group of 8 people. Service was slightly slow, but food was delicious. We allowed hosts to decide on menu for us all . Everyone agreed it was some of the best food we had in a long time. It's BYOB so bring lots of wine & enjoy.
Great evening and delicious flavors"
East Africa Restaurant,I've been wanting to come here for quite some time and I'm so glad I did. The food was exceptional - this was one of the best meals and dining out experiences I've had in many years. I can't recommend this place enough. I'll be back soon!
East Africa Restaurant,"Amazing food, well seasoned, packed with flavours. The food is clearly cooked with heart. I went there 2 weeks ago and I'm craving it already.
Come with patience as the cook makes everything to order and the wait could be a long one if 9 people suddenly arrive all at the same time. It's a bring-your-own-wine so when you have wine and good company, the wait is easily forgettable especially once the delicious food finally arrives.
It is the type of place you go there for the food experience rather than a restaurant experience -- The kitchen is ran like a home kitchen and the environment and the service needs improvement."
East Africa Restaurant,"What a great experience. It took a bit to get the food out but we drank and had a good laugh and then devoured the amazing food when it arrived. Different then most dining experiences, you eat with a group off of one big communal plate, but every bite was a great surprise."
East Africa Restaurant,"Amazing flavours and experience, hands down one of the most authentic dining experiences in Montreal. Just be sure to come with friends, share and not be in a rush because everything is made on the spot by the fantastic hosts!"
East Africa Restaurant,"incredible food! you will be waiting at least 1-2hours for it to be made (because there is just the one cook) so be ready for that but it is 1000% worth the patience. the food is so clearly made with love and care, it really feels like your mothers or grandmothers cooking! ive been a number of times, and i will keep coming back."
East Africa Restaurant,Went to eat at East Africa last night and the food was absolutely delicious. I shared a plate of lamb with the vegetarian plate and it was so tasty!!! it was my first time having Ethiopian food and I couldn't have asked for a better first time experience. Its run by a lovely couple and the restaurant is very authentic! will be definitely be going back! Thank you :)
East Africa Restaurant,Best ethiopian food ive ever had! Everything was unbeleivably fresh and very authentic. This place is as good as it gets.
East Africa Restaurant,"Excellent food, cooked and served by very nice people. Simple, authentic place offering delicious spicy and tasty meals. Everything is fresh and takes time to prepare. So dont come if youre in a rush or looking for a trendy set-up."
East Africa Restaurant,Great food and staff. The environment is calm and peaceful.
East Africa Restaurant,"This is the best Ethiopian food in Montreal. Super fresh, authentic, flavourful, and absolutely delicious! Great value for money since it is very filling. Lots of options for meat and veggie lovers. A great option for takeout as well- it's the ultimate comfort food. Try it!"
East Africa Restaurant,"This is by far one of the best food Ive eaten in a while. Delicious! Also, very interesting and somewhat exotic. Fully authentic and cooked from the heart. Thank you for this unforgettable experience. Will be back soon."
East Africa Restaurant,"I love East Africa Restaurant. The food, the service, the atmosphere at a great price.

Absolutely phenomenal Ethiopian cuisine in a cozy home-style vibe.

The food is made to order, and as others have said it's clearly made with love. Plan ahead for a bit of a wait, bring a nice bottle of wine or some good beer and enjoy your company.

The couple who run the restaurant are wonderful too. They're friendly and helpful and it's always a pleasure eating there.

The servings are generous and is great for sharing. I recommend East Africa Restaurant to everyone who moves to NDG.

Go and you won't be disappointed. I promise it's worth the wait."
East Africa Restaurant,"This restaurant is a very good typical restaurant. This is a great treat for people who like different food. This Ethiopian place is delicious and affordable. I enjoyed it a lot. If you like spicy, also the place to visit."
East Africa Restaurant,"I went there without knowing anything about Ethiopian food and it resulted in a pleasant surprise. The food was absolutely great! The server (who owns the place) welcomes you and is able to kindly explain the menu and how it all works. Basically, you order one dish per person and it all comes in a sort of ragout on top of a delicious crepe style bread. It is all for sharing. Expect to get a little messy because you DO eat with your hands. Not a big deal. We ordered the lamb #4 & #14, the beef #7 and fish. All of which were absolutely delicious. The spices used and flavors attained in each portion were exquisite. Highly recommended! The service was a bit slow, we waited over 30 mins to get our food, but it was WORTH it."
East Africa Restaurant,"Incredible food and experience, lovely owners. It feels as though youve been invited to the family home and being spoilt. There was a long wait, and you might start to get the hangry pains haha, but all is forgiven in that first bite! Highly recommended, cant wait to go back. BYOB."
East Africa Restaurant,"Amazing food! The service was fantastic, and the owners are so sweet. Best Ethiopian food I've had in a long long while, and I will definitely be returning! Thank you for the wonderful night!"
East Africa Restaurant,"So tasty. No meat left when I went, as it was the end of the day. This was my first experience with Ethiopan food and I am hooked. It was very flavorful and filling. Large portions and friendly people. Although I went looking for meat and ended up getting a vegetarian dish I was not disappointed and did not miss the meat (which cannot be said often for me). Wonderful little spot. Will definitely return again."
East Africa Restaurant,They spoke to us very rudely and made us feel not welcome. They refused to give us what we ordered and they yelled at my elderly mother very loudly. Horrible experience and horrible food. Also very expensive for the portion. Do not waste your time this is not good food or people
East Africa Restaurant,"Small, family run restaurant. Understated decor. Food is full of flavours and absolutely delicious.
Call ahead as seating is limited
There will be a wait for food, it is worth it. You're not there for the service, but the incredible food. And the owners are always friendly!

Edited to add, just did take out for the first time. Ordered last night for pick up tonight. Generous portions, packed with care. Just as delicious as in restaurant, and just as friendly when picking up!"
East Africa Restaurant,"Doesnt get more authentic than this. Ethiopian couple run this amazing place, both were so kind and hard working. The food is amazing. No cutlery, you eat with your hands. Delicious."
East Africa Restaurant,"This is a family-run restaurant. It's very intimate. No more than 8 tables.
The food is delicious! You can feel the flavours with all your senses. What you choose from the menu is cooked on the spot. No frozen preparations. That is why you have to wait untill you are served the food. Everything is freshly cooked.
You can bring your own wine - if you desire. They only serve water.
It's very clean and proper.

This is a unique, folkloric Ethiopian experience that certainly merits to return!"
East Africa Restaurant,"Hands down the best Ethiopian food Ive ever had. Everything about this spot screams authentic. Family run, homemade, real ingredients. Definitely a new favorite."
East Africa Restaurant,"Food is authentic but service and quality is below average. We went for dinner and my boyfriend ordered a chicken dish and received only 1 Drumstick, no gravy with it and very small amount of dry vegetarian dish to go with for price of $13+. Also, part of our food was really cold and some barely warm. My dish was good in terms of quantity but same issue, it was just slightly warm and became cold in 2 mins. I love trying food from different countries in Africa because I am also from there but I was really disappointed here for the second time. I wouldnt recommend this place."
East Africa Restaurant,"We're regulars here and just love the food. It's always delicious and flavourful, and disappears in minutes regardless of the size of the group. The food is cooked from scratch, so be prepared to wait around an hour to get your meal, maybe longer if it's busy, but we always place our order when we book our table. And it's always worth the wait! Whenever friends visit from out of town, we take them here to eat at least once."
East Africa Restaurant,"We've dined in numerous times in the last few years, and just had take-out for the first time yesterday. Same delicious food, great portion sizes, very well-packed for transport and the injera was prepared fresh for pickup. Friendly service and also nice that we could pre-order the night before for a specific pickup time. So happy we can still support local restaurants in these trying times!"
East Africa Restaurant,Excellent food! Fist time tasting Ethiopian - loved it!
East Africa Restaurant,Authentic Ethiopian food lovingly prepared. You feel that you are dining with family. Warm and friendly service. Do reserve ahead of time as it is a small venue. Be prepared for a fair wait time before your meal  is served as everything is made fresh to order
East Africa Restaurant,"One of my favorite restaurants in Montreal! Incredible flavors, real spice. It doesn't feel like they are holding back at all so it comes across as very authentic, especially when compared to a few other Ethiopian restaurants around Montreal. Bear in mind that service is slow because they make all the orders from scratch it order or whos ordered first. Even with the wait time it's well worth it. It could take 40minutes to get your food but it will be gone in 15. And it's bring your own wine!

If you like spicy, try the kitfo (but if you want it call in advance)! The lamb is delicious and the veggie combo is incredible! Reservations are strongly recommended."
East Africa Restaurant,"Cozy, delicious, what more is there to ask? Don't forget to bring your wine!
The place is run by a nice couple, so be a little patient with your order, it's well worth the wait."
East Africa Restaurant,"Friendly owners, delicious food, small and overpriced portions. This was my third visit to the restaurant, but my first as a group of 4. We found the portions much too small for the price, as it seems they will fit everything onto one plate, no matter how many dishes you order. So the more you order, the smaller each portion seems to get. We had to reorder because we were not even close to being full with our initial order. Dinner for 4 was $185 plus tip (no drinks, no side dishes), which is the type of pricing you expect from a much fancier restaurant than this simple, out-of-downtown venue. Will unfortunately not be returning."
East Africa Restaurant,"This is hands down the best East African food I've eaten, and I've tried probably a dozen restaurants in many cities. My wife and I arrived with our two-year-old son after a long day, choosing a random restaurant off the street. This was a bad choice - the restaurant is small and cramped, and we waited about an hour for our food. Our son was going crazy and it was miserable. So just imagine how good the food had to be for us to give it 5 stars after that!

The owner was very nice, and told us he understood our situation, but because everything is cooked fresh there was no way to speed things up. Good food takes time. So I highly recommend the restaurant, but not with small children! And be prepared to wait - bring some wine or beer and relax. It will be worth it.

Last note: this is the real deal. As far as I can tell the food has not been adjusted to fit North American pallettes, or at least not much. We love this, but not everyone will."
East Africa Restaurant,"Been there 5 times in the past year and it stills blows my mind how delicious the food is. Words cannot describe how sublime the texture, aroma and taste is! Incredible!

Pro tip: if you want to avoid waiting too much, call them in advance and ask them to start preparing your order right away. Do this, say, 30 or 45 minutes in advance and you're good to go!"
East Africa Restaurant,"This is my favorite restaurant. You wait forever for food, and getting a reservation is harder than getting into most colleges, but it's always worthwhile because the food is delicious. Eating here is a special special occasion, because of how good the food is and also because it's such a challenge to actually acquire the food. The owners are super nice. Come with a bottle of wine, with beer and with friends and just enjoy the luck you have in getting a table."
East Africa Restaurant,"The food delicious but expensive for the portion.

Everything is made as your order it so the wait can take upwards of an hour. It's also a BYOB so I recommend going to the SAQ nearby and bringing something to drink while you drink"
East Africa Restaurant,"An experience and a fantastic meal. Warm and personalized welcome and an explosion of incredible tastes. A bonus: this is a BYOW!!
We tried a lamb dish and a vegetarian combo and were very impressed by both.
Pro tip: food is prepared FRESH. Literally. So if you are short on time, call ahead of time and order your dish so they have time to prepare it for you."
East Africa Restaurant,"Some of the best food i've ever had, but as other reviews mention, wait times are atrocious. Go with friends so you have people to talk with. though, the meal will be better with more people anyways, as they have all the orders on a single plate to be shared amongst everyone. An amazing experience!

I'm a bit forgiving of the wait times because I think the entire place is run by two people. I'll definitely be coming back here for the food, despite the wait times and service."
East Africa Restaurant,This is our go-to restaurant in NDG.  It is has the best ethiopian food we have ever had and it is run by a lovely family.  They have great vegan and gluten free options plus its bring your own wine.  We have tried almost everything on the menu and loved it all!  Best to make a reservation.
East Africa Restaurant,"This is the BEST Ethiopian food in Montreal - no question. Thank you to the lovely couple that manages the restaurant and makes this delicious food! Small space but can still accommodate larger groups of 5-7 people. Reserve a table, bring your own wine and enjoy food for the soul."
East Africa Restaurant,"The food is good but the portions are small.  I was still hungry after I was done and there was nothing else on the menu. Also, they are always running out of the vegetarian options.  I went twice and had the same dish both times because all others were not available. The service is extremely slow but then they are only two running the restaurant and it is homestyle cooked meal so I am sure the ingredients are fresh and freshly-made.  An Ok place if you have a lot of time on your hands and craving Ethiopian injera."
East Africa Restaurant,"I went on a Saturday night and I was thoroughly impressed. I'm a fan of family run, homey places like this restaurant. I enjoyed the cozy atmosphere, the music vibing in the background and the lighting was soft and warm. It felt like I was eating in someone's house. The restaurant has 8 tables so it's based on reservations only. The food was well worth the wait. It is made to order by the same people who serve you so you know you get quality food. I spoke with one of the owners and he told me everything is fresh, bought daily and made every day. They make the injerra fresh as well! You can really taste the love in the food. Meat and veggie options, so it will satisfy all palates. Definitely an amazing date spot! Would recommend to everyone. 4/5"
East Africa Restaurant,Excellent place to bring your date with a bottle of wine and have nice conversation . Family run restaurant and its small and cozy inside. Food is cooked fresh and takes up to a hour so if you want fast food this is not the place for that. Best ethiopian food and portions are generous.
East Africa Restaurant,"Food is delicious with good portions. Only reason I am not rating 5 stars is due to the long wait time of 45 minutes to get the food. It was worth the wait, better flavor, better bread than Sheba and Blue Nile."
East Africa Restaurant,"Excellent restaurant, the best even. It has been my favorite for more than 7 years. Bring a bottle of wine and your friends !"
East Africa Restaurant,"Bad customer service.  I went there on my birthday with my wife, mom, brother and two of my kids. The owner was angry we ordered 3 dishes he told us that he could have given 3 of our seats to other customers. What a bad thing to say for someone who is trying your restaurant for the first time. He did not explain to us how Ethiopia food edicate works. We did not know that our food orders will be compiled into one dish in which all of us must share. Did not give us a pitcher of water we had to get that on our own and pour it into our own glasses. Did not give us napkins. Be careful heading to the washroom when you head down the stairs your head will hit something. The washroom is bad as well low hanging pipes that will hit your head. Food was ok but I would never go there again."
East Africa Restaurant,"DELICIOUS! absolutely amazing home cooked food with very friendly service. The wait can be a little long, but with bring your own wine it's no problem. The food is well worth the wait. ??????????"
East Africa Restaurant,"One of my favorite restaurants in montreal! Incredible flavors, real spice. It doesn't feel like they are holding back at all so it comes across as very authentic, especially when compared to a few other Ethiopian restaurants around Montreal. Bear in mind that service is slow because they make all the orders from scratch it order or whos ordered first. Even with the wait time it's well worth it. It could take 40minutes to get your food but it will be gone in 15. And it's bring your own wine!"
East Africa Restaurant,"As other reviews mention, the plate size could be bigger and the service is quite slow (I would say 60-90 minutes to get the food) so plan ahead and don't show up famished.
That being said, the food is absolutely delicious and still worth the price and the wait!"
East Africa Restaurant,"Best, most affordable Ethiopian food in Montreal. Everything is super fresh and is cooked by order, meaning it takes 45 minutes to an hour to receive your food, but it's well worth it. Bring wine for the wait, and don't come here in a rush, on a first date, or with people you don't like. Settle in for a lovely experience and delicious food."
East Africa Restaurant,"Interesting cultural experience. Not so much excited about eating with the hands, but it was interesting. No tea, no coffee... just cold  water. The door kept opening and we ended up keeping closing it so we will not feel cold. The serving took some time and no one came to take the order. No menus, no photos of dishes."
East Africa Restaurant,"If you want to have a cooked meal by someone's Ethiopian Mamma, you came to the right place. This is by far, by far the best Ethiopian cuisine. It's Vegeterian friendly, bring your own wine. I eat at the fanciest restaurants in the city all the time, and this hole in the wall is one of my favorite"
East Africa Restaurant,One of the best restaurants in Montreal. The curries and stews seem to have more flavour than is possible. Prepare to wait a long time for your order and walk out thinking it was worth the wait.
East Africa Restaurant,"We loved the delicately nuanced and delicious food! We knew it was a relaxed place so were prepared for them to wait as they made our food, which tasted like pure love! Great for vegans and carnivores alike. We will return often."
East Africa Restaurant,"We went on a Wednesday night around 7:30. We got a table right away, service was quick and it's BYOB. Laid-back atmosphere and delicious food with many vegan and meat options. New favourite Ethiopian place."
East Africa Restaurant,We  ordered take out and were impressed with presentation as well as quality and taste. It is by far the best take out we had ever had. The portions were generous and flavourful. Highly recommend. The best suggestion is to order the night before.
East Africa Restaurant,"This restaurant does NOT live up to the expectation, given the price they charge for the food and the quantity they give. It is an overpriced restaurant, with the owner being really rude and arrogant.

We ordered 4 different meals, each costing above $16 per meal. But the quantity we got given 4 meals and the price was extremely disappointing and not filling at all. I understand that they serve the meals together into one plate, but the quantity of food is totally
NOT worth it given the price.

We respectfully told the owner during payment that even though the food was good, it is very small amount in quantity - to which his reply was really rude, and said that is what we should get for the price we are paying. We told him
that other similar restaurants we went to would give a lot more amount for the price, to
which his reply was - he doesn't care what ofher restaurants charge and the portion they serve, because at this place this is what it is supposed to be.

It felt bad being treat this way. We paid a LOT for 4 meals, almost $70 in total, but hardly got a portion of meal equivalent to that amount.

Totally disappointing. Careful before you order and go there. Wouldn't recommend it!"
East Africa Restaurant,"This restaurant is probably my favorite restaurant in Montréal. The food is so tasty, the two owners are really nice. You know the food is good, when you can't keep yourself, saying each mouthful that is so good. You can bring your wine, and relax there. This place is priceless !"
East Africa Restaurant,"Terrible customer service.
Yesterday was our first time at this restaurant.
We were disrespectfully denied service for no valid reason, even though we placed our order in advance.
Their establishment was absolutely filthy.
I would not recommend eating at this restaurant.

I would highly recommend Queen Sheba in Montreal if you are looking for quality East African Food."
East Africa Restaurant,"The hour wait for for the food could not stop us from enjoying this authentic Ethiopian/Eritrean dinning experience. You may ask how I rate the food as being authentic?  My better half hails from Ethiopia and she gave the nod of approval...  and she is very hard to impress. The only thing missing is the traditional Ethiopian coffee, then you might be fooled into thinking you were eating this meal at someone's home in Habasha. Excellent food prepared lovingly by the proprietors cannot be praised enough!"
East Africa Restaurant,"I would have given it less than 1 star if allowed. This restaurant could be a best example of mismanagement and poor service. They let people come in and order and then undergo a long long waiting time for that food. And to top it all, no one brings WATER to your table unless you ask for it. Last time we had to wait for about 2 and a half hours for the same. The customers were again and again looking at the counter in the hope of seeing some food coming out of the kitchen. This is so embarrassing and torturous on the customer's part because firstly, they are paying for the food and then, when some people were inquiring the owner about the same, he was very arrogant and was behaving as if he was doing some kind of favor or charity on them. Sometimes, the people who had ordered, an hour after you, were getting served before you. The food is good but the price one has to pay in terms of waiting for it is exorbitant. We destroyed our entire Friday evening, just waiting for food. They should keep more people or atleast do some prep work before letting people in and pay more attention to the customers. Seriously, one should go here only when one has a lot of free time to kill!!!!"
East Africa Restaurant,"Wonderfully tasty food in small cozy old-fashioned restaurant. Lovely people, very friendly received us for an anniversary dinner! Very memorable <3"
East Africa Restaurant,"Delicious and tasty food. Living in Vancouver right now, I go to East Africa Restaurant every time I visit my family in Montreal. Expect a long wait (1-2h) for the service, but perfect place to spend a good time with friends."
East Africa Restaurant,"Absolutely the best Ethiopian restaurant in Montreal if not Canada. The flavours are incredible, and the owners are the sweetest couple. Been going there for years and its a must for every occasion."
East Africa Restaurant,"A family run place serving Ethiopian/Eritrean food. Nothing fancy, just the basics. On the plus side, the food they serve is very fresh and delicious. On the negative side, don't go there hungry because you will have to wait a looong time for your food."
East Africa Restaurant,Really warm welcome even though they hadn't opened until we knocked on the door. The food was prepared fresh and very tasty. I would recommend this place for everyone who wants to try out ethiopian cuisine in Montréal.
East Africa Restaurant,"Slow, self serve, bring your own wine, authentic, and delicious, will be going again! I personally love that it's slow, it's like a real home meal, you get to sit around and talk and interact over some wine without the usual rush of other restaurants. Good vibes."
East Africa Restaurant,Best Ethiopian food in MTL. I would strongly recommend doing a reservation. They get quite busy fast. Food is prepared on the spot so be prepared to wait a bit. Best of all? It's BYOB!
East Africa Restaurant,"We came here for a visit by chance and the food changed my life! Packed with flavor, warm energy and amazing service.  I'm coming back tomorrow and bringing more people. If you want some GREAT FOOD come by and bring friends."
East Africa Restaurant,"We love this place!  Friendly owners, cozy spot, and absolutely amazing food.  Such great spices in every dish we've tried, whether meat or vegetarian.  Looking forward to going back!  Grazie :)
Mario & Marie-Claude"
East Africa Restaurant,"I had the vegetarian combo and it was very filling and hearty. First time eating cuisine from Ethiopia. I thoroughly enjoyed it and would eat from here again, thank you."
East Africa Restaurant,"Its worth the wait.

In my opinion this remains to be the best restaurant in montreal. The service is slow but merited, considering how long it takes to bring all those delicious east african ingredients together into a delicious stew. I have been there twice and not once have I been disappointed by the quality of their food."
East Africa Restaurant,"I have tried my hardest, and have yet to over-hype this place. UNBELIEVABLE food. Long wait. Worth it. Spend some time chatting with your friends and then eat the best food you've ever had. Five stars doesn't even begin to describe it."
East Africa Restaurant,"The five stars are for the food!  Sooooooooo yummy!  However, be ready for a looooong wait, especially if you go on weekends.  The tables are served one at a time, in order of arrival.  But, believe me, the food is totally worth the wait! :)"
East Africa Restaurant,What horrible service... reservation taken but totally useless. Why take a reservation if you only serve 3 hours later. My date was severely unimpressed as well! All we had for 3 hours was water! They could have presented some appetizers or other nibbles to taste. The food being tasty is totally erased by the super lousy slow service and they the owners don't care..
East Africa Restaurant,"People aren't kidding about the wait, but the food is absolutely great and the owners are really friendly. Extremely laid-back atmosphere. Come with someone you actually want to talk to and bring something to drink."
East Africa Restaurant,"Amazing! This is the exact word to describe this place.
This was our second time at East Africa Restaurant and we had once again a real good time.
Food is delicious and on top of that the owners are kind  and very welcoming.
You want try East African food this is the place to go!"
East Africa Restaurant,I had never experienced waiting for food for 2 hours...before last night. There were no other drinks but water and the owner went grocery shopping once the orders for the 6 tables in the restaurant were in. The saddest part is that I am NOT even  exaggerating! The food is ok as far as the Ethiopian goes but the portions are extremely small.
East Africa Restaurant,This food is authentic. I've been in Ethiopia a long time and it tastes just like the food there. (One of the  chefs is Eritrean if I remember correctly.) Way better than Le Nil Bleu!
East Africa Restaurant,"Wonderful tasty food fresh made to order. Great vibe from owners/staff. Items 16, 19, 21 and 23 enjoyed. Thank you for feeding me with love"
East Africa Restaurant,Phenomenal food. Owners are super nice and you can tell the food is prepared with care. Truly a Montreal gem. I always come here whenever Im in the area.
East Africa Restaurant,"Food tastes good; however, service is slow and portions are small. If the last two items dont bother you then Id recommend."
East Africa Restaurant,"Ethiopian cuisine is unique, wholesome & delicious! I very much enjoyed my mixed vegetarian plate from EAR!"
East Africa Restaurant,"We were the only ones in the restaurant and it took an hour and a half before we even got food. They kept saying ""it's fresh"" but there is no reason any food should take that long. Finally got our food and mine was drenched in ginger. Both dishes were soggy. Will not return :("
East Africa Restaurant,"The food is delicious. The tef bread injera is perfect and gluten friendly, hosts are sweet and genuine. Simple, not fancy, byob. You should go."
East Africa Restaurant,"Excellent food, but strange that they didn't have any beverages (even tea, coke, juice) at all, only tap water. I'll definitely come here again, but will be armed with my own drinks!"
East Africa Restaurant,"You may have to wait for your food but boy is it worth it. They are in the back making things from scratch, bring your own wine and the food is absolute exquisite."
East Africa Restaurant,"Food is fantastic, well worth the very long wait.  Don't go if your hungry, or looking for a quick bite. 5 stars for the food."
East Africa Restaurant,"Amazing food worth the wait. Reserve and order in advanced if you want a quick service, its a mom and pop restaurant and they cook to order so there can be a little wait, but the food is really delicious!!!"
East Africa Restaurant,Extremely friendly and with great hospitality. Very lovely people and the food is authentic and amazing quality and taste ! I 100%
East Africa Restaurant,"We waited almost two hours for our dishes to come out. The food was good, however it really wasn't worth such a long wait. It made me sad to spend my money there. Will not go back."
East Africa Restaurant,Wow. Authentic Ethiopian food and at a great price.
East Africa Restaurant,"Never had a chance to try the food...as I entered the place and the gentleman said ""qu-est ce que tu veux ""? I asked if OPEN (picture attached ) and he says "" je suis fermée "". Bad day? Maybe..."
East Africa Restaurant,"Food was very tasty, but waited 2+ hours for food and the portions were absolutely tiny! Barely received enough food for 1 person that was supposed to be split between two. Not cheap for that much food either."
East Africa Restaurant,"Amazing Ethiopian food, and such nice folks. We were a group of 12 and they were extremely accommodating, and the food was perfect for vegetarian sharing"
East Africa Restaurant,"It took 2 hours to get our food, like everyone else in the restaurant. There are no soda or drinks avaliable beside water. The portions are small and, as far as Ethiopian food goes, it's average."
East Africa Restaurant,"Hidden gem of NDG. Their vegetarian combo is simply genius.
Protip: sometimes they don't pick up the phone, but when you leave a message, they always call back."
East Africa Restaurant,"Excellent food, lovely people. Yes, the food takes a while and yes, why not BYOB for the wait. It is all worth it as far as I'm concerned :)"

East Africa Restaurant,"An all time favourite! Simply delicious food, and authentically warm service. Bring a bottle of wine or beer, sit back and enjoy the evening!"
East Africa Restaurant,"Smells delicious but such a bad costumer service, walked in , the place was empty and they famed us feel totally unwanted there.  The place says they gave take out but when asked they said they couldnt cause the food they  was already promised ... a Saturday at 6pm ...."
East Africa Restaurant,"Authentic Ethiopian food, just like I remembered from my trip. Expect a bit of a wait, but it's well worth it, because it is made fresh."
East Africa Restaurant,Definitevely should work on their cook time organization. Never been in a restaurant and had to wait hours before  having my meals. Food tastes good.

East Africa Restaurant,"So so so delicious! Blown away every time I have supper here, and very glad they are offering take away!"

East Africa Restaurant,"(Translated by Google) Literally my favorite restaurant! He introduced me to Ethiopian gastronomy years ago and since then I have never found such perfect seasonings! Bring your own wine too... What more could you ask for? The wait is a little longer than in other restaurants, but it's a single couple who takes care of the service and the cooking from A to Z. They are two super interesting and friendly people. I wish them lots of success and health!

(Original)
Littéralement mon restaurant préféré! Il m'a faite découvrir la gastronomie éthiopienne il y a des années et, depuis, je n'ai jamais retrouvé d'assaisonnements aussi parfaits!  Apportez votre vin en plus... Quoi demander de mieux? L'attente est un peu plus longue que dans d'autres restos, mais c'est un seul couple qui s'occupe du service et de la cuisine de A à Z. Ce sont deux personnes super intéressantes et aimables. Je leur souhaite plein de succès et de santé!"
East Africa Restaurant,"(Translated by Google) One of the best kept secrets of Notre-Dame-de-Grâce (NDG). This great little family-run Ethiopian restaurant is really nice. The food is authentic, delicious and seasoned with the flavors of Ethiopia. My favorite dish is the Veggie Combo / Vegetarian Combined Dish. I recommend to everyone.

(Original)
Un des secrets les mieux gardés de Notre-Dame-de-Grâce (NDG). Ce super petit resto éthiopien familial est vraiment sympa. La nourriture est authentique, délicieuse et assaisonnée aux arômes de l'Éthiopie. Mon plat favoris c'est le Veggie Combo /  Plat Combiné Végétarien. Je recommande à toutes et tous."
East Africa Restaurant,"(Translated by Google) Restaurant that does not look like much, but is worth the detour.
Expect a short wait, about an hour.
The dishes were very good, whether vegetarian or not.
The price/quality ratio was also very good.
The couple of restaurateurs were adorable.
I highly recommend.

(Original)
Restaurant qui ne paye pas de mine, mais qui vaut le détour.
Il faut s'attendre à un peu d'attente, une heure environ.
Les plats étaient très bon, qu'ils soient végétariens ou non.
Le rapport qualité/prix était lui aussi très convenable.
Le couple de restaurateurs était adorable.
Je recommande vivement."
East Africa Restaurant,"(Translated by Google) Really delicious food. A great discovery. Family atmosphere and warm welcome. The wait is worth it!

(Original)
Bouffe vraiment succulente. Une belle découverte. Ambiance familiale et bel accueil. L'attente en vaut la peine !"
East Africa Restaurant,"(Translated by Google) Best Ethiopian restaurant in Montreal. I am never disappointed when we go there. The owners are lovely and so welcoming! Memorable discussion, warm atmosphere and wonderful food. Yes it's true there is a wait but everything is cooked on site, so this wait is worth it.

(Original)
Meilleur resto Éthiopien à Montréal. Je ne suis jamais déçu quand on y va. Les propriétaires sont charmant et tellement acceuillant! Discussion mémorable, ambiance chaleureuse et nourriture formidable. Oui cest vrai il ya de lattente mais tout est cuisiné sur place, donc cette attente en vaut la peine."
East Africa Restaurant,"(Translated by Google) Small cozy restaurant. We were well advised for the choice of food, the fish is succulent. Bring a bottle of wine while waiting for your meal, you will have a great evening...Experience to repeat!

(Original)
Petit resto chaleureux.  On a été bien conseillé pour le choix de nourriture, le poisson est succulent. Apportez vous une bouteille de vin en attendant votre repas, vous passerai une belle soirée...Expérience à refaire!"
East Africa Restaurant,"(Translated by Google) Best Ethiopian food on the island of Montreal!!! The value for money is amazing and the couple who run the place are welcoming, warm and friendly. I highly recommend and I can't wait to go back. p.s. it's not officially written, but it's a bring your own wine ;)
Health!

(Original)
Meilleur nourriture éthiopienne sur l'île de Montréal!!! Le rapport qualité prix est épatant et le couple qui tient la place est accueillant, chaleureux et sympathique. Je recommande fortement et j'ai déjà hâte d'y retourner. P.s. c'est pas officiellement écrit, mais c'est un apportez votre vin ;)
Santé!"
East Africa Restaurant,"(Translated by Google) Delicious and with an amazing atmosphere. We were served quickly compared to what many reviews mention (after 40min). The cuisine is refined, freshly made by the cook. The small raw room, the unfussy server, the rudimentary organization of the place and the atmosphere created by the customers who take their time is pleasant, out of the ordinary. It is useful to come with your drink (otherwise there is a convenience store opposite).

(Original)
Délicieux et à l'ambiance épatante. On a été servi rapidement à comparer à ce que mentionnent de nombreux avis (au bout de 40min). La cuisine est raffinée, fraîchement faite par la cuisinière. La petite salle brute, le serveur sans chichis, l'organisation du lieu rudimentaire et l'ambiance créé par les clients qui prennent leur temps est agréable, hors du commun. Il est utile de venir avec votre boisson (sinon y'a un dépaneur en face)."
East Africa Restaurant,"(Translated by Google) Very good dishes! On the other hand, you have to expect a long wait to receive the dishes. So don't be in a hurry. Very reasonable price (value for money)

(Original)
Très bons plats! Par contre il faut s'attendre à une longue attente pour recevoir les plats. Donc il ne faut surtout pas être pressé. Prix très raisonnable (rapport qualité prix)"
East Africa Restaurant,"(Translated by Google) Wow, a really authentic taste that left me nostalgic for our last trip to Ethiopia. Like many restaurants, our second time was even better, our varied vegetarian plate satisfied our taste buds with 98% of the flavors of mother earth. The order takes around 1 hour to be ready, but it is well worth the time and the cost! We also received a very warm welcome from the owners. It's up to you to enjoy ??.

(Original)
Wow, un goût vraiment authentique mayant laissé nostalgique de notre dernier voyage en Éthiopie. Comme plusieurs restaurant, notre deuxième fois était encore mieux, notre assiette variée végétarien a su combler nos papilles gustatives à 98% près des saveurs de la terre mère. La commande prends environs 1 heures pour être prête, mais ça en vaut de loin le temps et le coût ! Nous avons aussi reçu un accueil très chaleureux de la part des propriétaires. À vous de vous délecter ??."
East Africa Restaurant,"(Translated by Google) We moved from the south shore to go there a few weeks ago. We placed a takeout order and it took 2 hours to get our order. Yes, 2 hours!!! And they warned us that it will take that long only when we have already paid. Coming from the south shore, we also had to pay 2 hrs of parking to wait. Such a long delay is unacceptable, especially since we didn't see anyone else coming to pick up an order, so it wasn't that busy. The food is ok but not worth the trip or the waiting time. Never again for us!

(Original)
On s'est déplacé de la rive-sud pour aller là-bas il y a quelques semaines de cela. On a placé une commande à emporter et ça a pris 2 heures avant d'avoir notre commande. Oui, 2 heures!!! Et ils nous ont averti que cela allait prendre autant de temps seulement quand on a déjà payé. Venant de la rive-sud, on a donc aussi dû payer 2 hrs de stationnement pour attendre. Un délai aussi long est inacceptable, surtout qu'on n'a vu personne d'autre venir chercher une commande, donc ce n'était pas si occupé. La nourriture est ok mais ne vaut pas le déplacement ni le temps d'attente. Plus jamais encore pour nous!"
East Africa Restaurant,"(Translated by Google) I went to Ethiopia and loved the food there! At East Africa, it tastes like in Ethiopia and the couple who run the restaurant are adorable. I recommend the Shiro! Far surpasses Blue Nile and Queen Sheba!

(Original)
Je suis allez en Éthiopie et j'ai adoré la cuisine là-bas! Chez East Africa, ça goûte comme en Éthiopie et le couple qui gère le resto est adorable. Je recommande le Shiro! Surpasse de loin Nil Bleu et Queen Sheba!"
East Africa Restaurant,"(Translated by Google) A little disappointed.. the waiting time, even after having reserved and ordered the dishes in advance, was really too long (about 2 hours..). Luckily we had our bottles of wine in the meantime!
It's a couple a bit old who manages the room and the kitchen in a really limited space, hence the waiting time.
The experience was nice for the ``I eat with my hands`` side, but I have known better Ethiopian restaurants in terms of taste and flavor. By cons I found that the prices were not expensive for an African restaurant.

(Original)
Un peu déçue.. le temps d'attente, même après avoir reservée et commandé les plats à l'avance, a été vraiment trop long (environ 2h..). Heureusement nous avions nos bouteilles de vins en attendant!
C'est un couple un peu agé qui gère la salle et la cuisine dans un espace vraiment restreint, d'ou le temps d'attente.
L'experience était sympa pour le côté ``je mange avec mes mains`` mais j'ai connu de meilleurs restaurants ethiopiens au niveau gout et saveurs. Par contre j'ai trouvé que les prix n'étaient pas chers pour un restaurant africain."
East Africa Restaurant,"(Translated by Google) Really exotic in the heart of Montreal (NDG) a gastronomic experience to live absolutely - first time that I am in a restaurant and that there are no utensils to eat. Note that we were four to five tables, not arriving at the same time, but we were all served at the same time. so be patient......but it was all worth it.

(Original)
Vraiment dépaysant en plein montreal (NDG) une expérience gastronomique à vivre absolument - première fois que je suis dans un restaurant et qu'il n'y a aucun ustensiles pour manger . fait à noter, nous étions quatre à cinq tables, pas arriver en même temps, mais nous avons tous été servi en même temps.  donc soyez patient ......mais le tout valait la peine."
East Africa Restaurant,"(Translated by Google) Amazing taste, nice and discreetly funny people. U want to get a taste of it. Take your time and enjoy!

Yum yum yum yum. Delicious, you must try it! Take your time!

Bete Africa Ethiopian Restaurant and Bar,"I just had the most delicious meal at Bete Africa.  A mixed vegetable platter with Awaze Tibbs (stew), and a mound of injera (sour batter flat bread).  Very generous serving, we are both so stuffed!"
Bete Africa Ethiopian Restaurant and Bar,Sincerely the best Ethiopian food I've had in all of Edmonton! I love the family atmosphere and the service my partner and I had was incredibly personal and lovely.

Bete Africa Ethiopian Restaurant and Bar,"Went there 12 hours ago for the first time ever, and I wasn't disappointed. Give this restaurant a try, and I promise you won't regret it. The lady was super nice and quick with the order.
The menu is full of a variety of food to try out. Prices range from $16-$20 and you can't even finish the portion."
Bete Africa Ethiopian Restaurant and Bar,"If you've never tried Ethiopian food, this is the place to start, I don't think you'll want to go anywhere else.

An homely restaurant with a calm authentic Ethiopian atmosphere. The staff give very good menu recommendations if you can't decide what to order."
Bete Africa Ethiopian Restaurant and Bar,"I drive all the way from Spruce Grove just to eat at Beta Africa because the food is that good. The authentic Ethiopian cuisine is absolutely delicious, with outstanding flavors and perfectly soft injera. The menu offers a great selection of dishes at reasonable prices, with generous portions.

The service is exceptional, with knowledgeable staff who are always happy to provide recommendations just be sure to let them now what your spice tolerances is. Overall, I highly recommend Beta Africa for anyone looking for a fantastic dining experience with authentic Ethiopian cuisine. It's definitely worth the drive"
Bete Africa Ethiopian Restaurant and Bar,"Geminas food is AMAZING. I live away from home now so I dont get my moms Ethiopian food as often anymore but this place makes it authentic and it tastes homemade. Delicious food, great service, and generous portions. Will definitely be coming back when Im feeling homesick."
Bete Africa Ethiopian Restaurant and Bar,"This restaurant needs to be on your bucket list! The food was so good and the owner is really kind and generous. Loved it, will come back !"
Bete Africa Ethiopian Restaurant and Bar,"Best food, service, and restaurant! I crave their food often and am never disappointed. I do not wish to go anywhere else for Ethiopian food. I get the vege platter each time and one meat dish.

**edit**
After posting my review I was craving their food so I decided to stop in for the individual veggie combo with the mills cha-cha tibs ??"

(Please note that this restaurant is not wheelchair accessible. There is one step up at the front door into a narrow entrance. The bathroom is down a flight of stairs.)"
Bete Africa Ethiopian Restaurant and Bar,Weve been to a few Ethiopian restaurants and this is the best place bu far!! Lots of flavour and good portions. Highly recommend!!
Bete Africa Ethiopian Restaurant and Bar,"The best place and the best food also the best place to buy Ethiopian food. The service was very helpful and very nice ??????

Bete Africa Ethiopian Restaurant and Bar,Went here for supper tonight with my husband. We both agreed that this place has the best Ethiopian food we have had. All the items we ordered were absolutely delicious and I appreciated the owners suggestions on some dishes to try as well. Love supporting family owned and run businesses and this one is an absolute gem! We will definitely be back (and can't wait to bring friends!)
Bete Africa Ethiopian Restaurant and Bar,I have know the lady for years and always been feeding me amazing habesha food.
Bete Africa Ethiopian Restaurant and Bar,Absolutely Amazing! The service and the food are the best in the city!

Bete Africa Ethiopian Restaurant and Bar,The chef was amazing. The food was absolutely delicious. Like I was full but kept eating! Lol so good. They're fixing the basement and will have more room soon! Come take a look and give the chef a hello. She was amazing and curtious. Thank you for everything! ??
Bete Africa Ethiopian Restaurant and Bar,First and amazing Ethiopian food ever!! The waitress was lovely and helped us pick the dishes and kept checking in (felt like I was with a family member ??). The food is otherworldly and the dishes are so complex and rich. Can't wait to visit again
Bete Africa Ethiopian Restaurant and Bar,"It was my first time trying Ethiopian food and it was a great experience! A very quaint place, seeming run by 1-2 employees. Service was quick and our waitress was kind.

The coffee was very decadent and rich. We found out that they roast and grind the beans in-house!

I would definitely come by again and support this local gem :)"
Bete Africa Ethiopian Restaurant and Bar,"The atmosphere was nice, the food tasted amazing and the price was fair. What more could i ask for?"
Bete Africa Ethiopian Restaurant and Bar,"Amazing food (especially if you like spicy foods), great portion for the price! One thing I found really interesting was whenever I ordered take-out here, she would hit the ""no tip"" button on the payment terminal."
Bete Africa Ethiopian Restaurant and Bar,Absolutely delicious! I highly recommend the combination plates - they are perfect because you get to try a bit of many different dishes. Love their food!!!
Bete Africa Ethiopian Restaurant and Bar,Wonderful food and lovely owner!  Thank you!
Bete Africa Ethiopian Restaurant and Bar,"Tried this place because reviews were good. We were not disappointed! Server was the owner and what a lovely lady.  We ordered some beef, lamb and veggie dishes. We cleaned up! It was so tasty. I will definitely come here again! I highly recommended this restaurant. Must try."
Bete Africa Ethiopian Restaurant and Bar,"Really enjoyed my meal at Bete Africa.  Authentic African cuisine, a quaint, friendly and comfortable atmosphere. The injira was so fresh  and the platter that we had was fantastic.  Many different flavors and choices from vegan to carnivore friendly.  I will be back with my boys to enjoy this little gem again."
Bete Africa Ethiopian Restaurant and Bar,"Had a wonderful meal with friends here. We chose the ""all in one"" meal option to share amongst us. This was a great choice for us as there was a little of everything. The owner was our server and he was so passionate about the food. He took the time to explain each item to us, and went over everything prior to us ordering.

The food was absolutely amazing. The lamb was delicious with just the right amount of spice.

Finished off with coffee which was a perfect way to end the evening."
Bete Africa Ethiopian Restaurant and Bar,This place was awesome. Great food. Great atmosphere. Great price. Couldnt recommend this place enough!!!
Bete Africa Ethiopian Restaurant and Bar,"This place is absolutely fantastic. The service is so kind. If you love Ethiopian food, you will not be disappointed. The serving sizes are big, if you see a big price, that's because you will be feeding alot of people. Ask about serving sizes of you aren't sure, the staff are happy to talk to you. When we came here with our family it was my first restaurant experience out of the hospital and it was so warm and inviting.

If you love meat usually and are disappointed by the amount of veggies on the menu, trust me, these veggies pack so much flavor you will not be missing the meat and this is coming from someone who almost always has to correct that thought in my head when eating Ethiopian. Don't be scared of the veggie stews. It's not by any means a side of steamed veggies beside your lamb. No no no. You will very likely prefer these veggie stews over the meats. Not to say the meats are bad, they're just very filling, and you will want to eat and share with your party and finish your plater while having a good time, veggie stew options sit a little nicer for that and the meat can be a nice little treat.

You can order as much of the bread as you would like. Don't stress take your time, share.

I definitely recommend the coffee afterwards. It's a thick Ethiopian coffee that they roast in house and we felt so lucky to see our (it honestly feels deminutive to call her a waitress since she was so involved) roast the beans from green, bring out the grounds, tell us about the origins of even the coffee set.

She asked us if we were sensitive to scent and if we would like some incense that helps settle the stomach. I really appreciate this because I am sensitive to some scents but traditional incense, unless it involves pine or cedar, is fine with me (as far as I know) so we had coffee and smelled the incense as our (Barista/waitress/historian) puts up with me trying to pin down what kind of incense it is because it smells so nice.

She saw I was making an effort and she gave me some. It was an incredible evening and we had leftovers to share. I hope you do well with your business and you live up to your name."
Bete Africa Ethiopian Restaurant and Bar,Loved it! Nice and courteous staff and very delicious food.
Bete Africa Ethiopian Restaurant and Bar,I eat tons of ethiopian and eritrean food. Hands down.. bete africa is best place for ethiopian food in city!! The owner is so lovely and friendly and always remembers me and my orders and makes it such an amazing experience! I love it here so much. You must try it here!
Bete Africa Ethiopian Restaurant and Bar,"***AMAZING food, slower service***

The food we had at Bete Africa was incredibly delicious; hands-down some of the best Ethiopian food in Edmonton.  The decor was beautiful, and the owners were very pleasant, and offered lots of advice, since a couple people in our group of 6 had never had Ethiopian food before; My one issue was that our food took nearly an hour to arrive, to the point we were about to ask for it to just be packed up for takeaway, they brought it to the table.  Drink orders took a while as well.

Everything was delicious!  We ordered the All-in-One Special (which might be why things took so long, but a heads-up would have been helpful when we ordered).  This is a huge combo platter with a little bit of everything and LOTS of injera.  We came fairly close to crushing it between the 6 of us, but it easily could feed 8-10 people.  It was also INCREDIBLY affordable, coming to $20 each, including tip.

I can't even begin to express how delicious this food is, but if you're coming here during the week for lunch, maybe book some extra time beyond an hour to account for service.  I definitely will recommend this to others, and will be back myself, but will make sure it's on a day I'm not in a hurry.

Thank you so much for a wonderful experience. I will definitely be back!"
Bete Africa Ethiopian Restaurant and Bar,I called for an order for a work gathering and was able to have the food ready for noon instead of their normal 1 PM opening time. That was nice. However when I arrived the owner told me a much different price from what she quoted me on the phone. Be aware that she supposedly has increased all prices by $2. She's also closed on Tuesdays.
Bete Africa Ethiopian Restaurant and Bar,"This is one of my favourite spots in Edmonton. The smell (especially after incense) is euphoric. I love the lady there, she knows her food is good and doesnt need to charm you, though she is not rude either! I love the blue walls too, its such a bright place to go all year round.

I brought my family and we ordered coffee after the meal, was a game changer!"
Bete Africa Ethiopian Restaurant and Bar,"Amazing food, and friendly atmosphere! The vegetarian platter for two and shiro wot were delicious and the portion size was more than enough. After our meal we were brought a complimentary bowl of popcorn; we left completely stuffed!"
Bete Africa Ethiopian Restaurant and Bar,"So delicious and deceptively filling! The owner is a passionate home coffee roaster, and my god, as a home coffee roaster myself, that was one of the best cups of coffee Ive ever had!
They really know how to blend spices! Each dish was delicious, and their sour dough bread went perfectly with everything! Highly recommended!"
Bete Africa Ethiopian Restaurant and Bar,"Hidden gem! We ordered 2 of the $100 platters, they were heaping and delicious, wish I would have taken pictures. We will definately be back.
The bathroom was a little scary... but food was too amazing to care."
Bete Africa Ethiopian Restaurant and Bar,Finger licking good. I had their vegetarian dish and you wouldnt notice the lack of meat because everything else so delicious. I would recommend it.
Bete Africa Ethiopian Restaurant and Bar,"The decor was inviting and service by Jemila was very friendly. Every bite was delicious! We loved using the injera to scoop up food with our fingers; it's a great bonding experience. So much work and care goes into the preparation of their Ethopian food. Coffee was serve postmeal with a burning incense and was a perfect end to our meal.
P.S. Bete is a peanut free restaurant and the injera has no gluten. Washrooms are downstairs and not accessible for people using mobility devices."
Bete Africa Ethiopian Restaurant and Bar,"Delicious food, excellent service , friendly atmosphere, if you are like us and didn't know what to order, ask for the wish dish and they will make you a platter! You eat with your hands using ingera bread, it's spicy but not overly hot. Lots of vegetables and some tasty meat as well. Oh and order the coffee after your meal, strongest coffee ever, amazing flavor"
Bete Africa Ethiopian Restaurant and Bar,"Ordered some food to take away. Food was tasty and I did not get sick. Took away two stars because the place was grungy - from the door handle to the door frame to the counter where you picked up the food and paid for it. Took away one star for how the food was packed - Njera and rest of the dish all packed in one aluminum container, rather than keeping it separate, making the Njera all soaked."
Bete Africa Ethiopian Restaurant and Bar,AMAZING FOOD!!!  stopped there at a friends recommendation when passing through Edmonton and was not disappointed! Ive been dreaming of the food ever since! Service was quick and friendly!
Bete Africa Ethiopian Restaurant and Bar,"Yeah, we eat here consistently, and are experienced at trying Ethiopian food as opportunities arise.  The deep flavours of food are remarkable, for both vegetable and meat dishes and injera (flat bread), which is why we keep returning.  But, the service and kitchen are slow, and the decor simple."
Bete Africa Ethiopian Restaurant and Bar,Loved loved loved the meal tonight! I'm so happy my friend brought me here. The coffee is delicious and all the vegatrian options are so flavourful! I would definitely come back.
Bete Africa Ethiopian Restaurant and Bar,"Very delicious food and amazing service!!
The lady there even brought the ingredients to show me how her injera is made! Very sweet of her! Cannot speak enough on how good the dining experience was!"
Bete Africa Ethiopian Restaurant and Bar,Oh my!!  What a great meal to share with our son and his wife.  Decently priced and well portioned.  Finishing off with Ethiopian coffee was the best desert.  We will be back again
Bete Africa Ethiopian Restaurant and Bar,"Amazing food! Amazing service!!!
I love Ethiopian food in general, I've been to all the Ethiopian restaurants in the city but hands down.. this is the best Ethiopian restaurant in the city by far! The food is so hot and so fresh, as well as the fresh injera! I highly recommend this restaurant for the true authentic taste of ethopia! LOVE LOVE LOVE!  jamila, the owner is the sweetest lady I've ever met, amazing customer service, always fast & can handle so many people at once. Foods always fresh!!"
Bete Africa Ethiopian Restaurant and Bar,"When I am in the area I love ordering their vegetarian combo to go. It is extremely delicious, fills me up  for supper and there is enough leftover for a tasty lunch the next day. Very fast and friendly service."
Bete Africa Ethiopian Restaurant and Bar,Better place to eat the best food.
Bete Africa Ethiopian Restaurant and Bar,"Aweful. I've been to many Ethiopian restaurants in Edmonton and this is by far one of the worst. My husband and I came here as it was recommended to us. The server was friendly, and the food came out promptly. The presentation was standard as were portions. I ordered the vegetarian combo and my husband ordered a beef dish. I found the combo tasty, but most of the dishes were cold - both my husband and I are certain we got food poisoning. To add to this horrible experience, the other (only) patron in the restaurant was completely drunk and belligerent."
Bete Africa Ethiopian Restaurant and Bar,"Amazing! Recently moved to Edmonton, and didn't think we'd find an Ethiopian restaurant as good as the one we left behind in Hamilton, ON. We were happy to be wrong on that front: the vegetarian platter is amazing, and the shira wot (sp?) was delicious, with just enough heat--not like the atomic levels of spice we've encountered elsewhere. Will definitely be back."
Bete Africa Ethiopian Restaurant and Bar,"10/10 service, food was top-notch, and 100% Teff was used in the injera. Hands down best Ethiopian restaurant in the city."
Bete Africa Ethiopian Restaurant and Bar,"I ordered the shiro wot with beef, which came with some of the best injera I have ever had. Thick and spongy and unbelievably fresh - wow. I complimented it and was told they make it fresh on site, which I can definitely believe.I think this is the fourth Ethiopian restaurant I've tried in Edmonton and definitely my favorite so far (the others being Blue Nile, Walia, Langano Skies)."
Bete Africa Ethiopian Restaurant and Bar,"Best Ethiopian food in town hands down, the owner is amazing she caters to you from the moment you walk through the doors.
I have this dish called chacha wit some veggies I recommend it to anybody who's a fan of beef."
Bete Africa Ethiopian Restaurant and Bar,I went there with my family and an old college friend from Ethiopia. The food was great and tasty. The coffe was tastless and not fresh. The service was too bad. We asked extra spice and the server didn't give us. The men restroom stinks and no hand towels. When the bill came I handed my Visa card to the server. He told me they only accept debt card. I took out my debt card and gave it to him. He told me again that is visa card too. I showed the word debt on my visa debt card and explained him how the system works in US. Over all our server was carless and looked unprofessional.
Bete Africa Ethiopian Restaurant and Bar,"The food is delicious, and the service is absolutely fantastic. My favourite Ethiopian place in the whole city, and I have been to them all."
Bete Africa Ethiopian Restaurant and Bar,"Tried this place because reviews were good. We were not disappointed! Server was the owner and what a lovely lady. We ordered some beef, lamb and veggie dishes. We cleaned up! It was so tasty. I will definitely come here again! I highly recommended this restaurant. Must try."
Bete Africa Ethiopian Restaurant and Bar,Wow this place is amazing delicious food they have quality food everytging is fresh and if you want to be happy in your all day go to this restaurant and you will see a lot of thing surprise and happy. Relaxing music

Rayyan Restaurant,"Delicious food, balanced nutritious meals large portions, cones quickly, brought by a friendly and helpful server.  Even the chef comes out to talk to the guests.  The price is right.  It exceeded our expectations."
Rayyan Restaurant,Best halal restaurant with very reasonable price. The waiter was very polite and extremely fast in service! I wish I could give them more stars. Must try the lamb shank with a special type of spicy white sauce that I never seen before!!! Best African cuisine ever!
Rayyan Restaurant,This was the best Somali food I had in years. The lunch dishes were so good that we came back the next day for breakfast (pictured) which was delicious too. The atmosphere and the vibes just feels like home made food.
Rayyan Restaurant,"If you want to try authentic East African food, this is it. Not only is the food really good, the service is awesome.

Imagine home cooked meals as fast or even faster than faster than fast food.

Well not quite home cooked, I cant cook this good.

Even after two meals were eaten, we had a whole meal left over!!!

Listen just do it. Delicious."
Rayyan Restaurant,NOOR the owner and his team at Rayyan restaurant catered for 20 people an incredibly delicious Africa style breakfast brunch ! The mastery of his cooking is an unforgettable experience for my taste buds and I will absolutely be going back for more . The whole set up from start to finish was amazing from how meticulous to the level of professionalism he and his team put it all together. They truly went way above my expectations and left me with a WOW factor ! NOORs warmth and big hearted demeanour spoke for itself with how he had presented each dish and finger licking delicious ?? I highly recommend hands down to go and enjoy this beautiful restaurant and the team on site ?? what a wonderful event at RAYYAN RESTAURANT KUDOS !!
Rayyan Restaurant,I ate here 3 times when I was visiting from fort McMurray and Im sad to see they are closed down. Their food was so flavourful. If the owner sees this please contact me because your food is too good not to have a restaurant. If I can help with opening a new restaurant I would like to.
Rayyan Restaurant,"This is definitely the best restaurant in Edmonton, in all aspects: taste, quality, quantity, and price! You can feel that they really care about their customers whether you will dine-in or have it delivered. The perfect family-owned restaurant, strongly recommended!
I usually prefer delivery, some dish recommendations to try: the lamb shank, the chicken BBQ, and the beef muscles, you should order rice with each dish!"
Rayyan Restaurant,"Excellent customer service, i felt welcomed by the staff from the moment I walked into the door.

And I can't say enough about the food, the fish was amazing and the portions were generous.

Looking forward to returning!"
Rayyan Restaurant,"10/10 Rayyan graciously gave us food for our students at QE high school, the rice, chicken legs, sweet chilli chicken, breaded fish, and meat were expertly flavoured and super tasty! Cant recommend this restaurant enough, you will not be disappointed!"
Rayyan Restaurant,"This place was really good! The food smelled amazing and the beef was really soft. Definitely a lot of food for the full meal, worth it!"
Rayyan Restaurant,This is definitely the best African restaurant in Edmonton maybe even the whole of Alberta. This have the real legit fried whole fish and the prices are super amazing. Very classy interior and best customer service
Rayyan Restaurant,"Great food, great service! Nice clean restaurant. The staff were friendly and attentive. Private dining for women who would prefer it. Definitely recommend it !"
Rayyan Restaurant,"One Of the finest family owned Restaurants in downtown Edmonton.
The chefs are the owners... food never changes always taste the same food...if you visit them more than once you are not only customer you will become Family.
Unbelievable taste,fairly priced, service is like you never seen before.
LOVE YOU GUYS YOU ARE THE BEST."
Rayyan Restaurant,Great Restaraunt! The food was beyond our expectations. We had a group here for a small party and everything came out delicious and quite quick as well. Very fresh and enjoyable. The customer service was great as well. They checked in with us many times and did and an excellent job in providing us with everything we needed. Highly recommended!!
Rayyan Restaurant,"I ordered for for my daughter reception. Everything was excellent. I ordered rice with goat and chicken. The food came with salad and a variety of sauce, lemon, green chillies and red chillies.  The price for very good and customer service was excellent.
I will highly recommend this place."
Rayyan Restaurant,This place is a hidden gem!! Their food is really gooood. I wish I could give them more stars. Theyre always friendly too and offering complimentary soups and other snacks. My partner and I either dine in or take out at this place almost every chance we get.
Rayyan Restaurant,"Came here for breakfast with family. We ordered the diced beef, omlete, tea and mango shake. We loved it, service was 1000/10, food was great, definitely coming back here.

Rayyan Restaurant,"We ordered catering for a work event and Rayyan absolutely exceeded all expectations. From ordering until picking up the food, the customer service was super patient and friendly. As for the portions, they provided so much - which was greatly appreciated. The attendees went for seconds and took food to go home. We would order again AND recommend to friends."
Rayyan Restaurant,"We ordered diced beef, fish Basa, chicken bbq, paratha & pasta with rice. Big portions reasonable price and very tasty. Their soup was free and delicious. First time in Edmonton and as soon as we saw East African we wanted to try and were very satisfied. Thank you! Chef is friendly and down to earth."
Rayyan Restaurant,"This was my first time trying Somali/Kenyan food.

We were greeted by the host and seated right away. The host brought us soups (on the house) and the menus. He then left and came back with 3 jugs (2 juices and 1 water - again, on the house) and asked if we had any questions. They were very accommodating in explaining what each item on the menu was.

We ordered chicken mashkaki, salmon, lamb shank, tilapia, and sides of bread, rice, and vegetables. The food quality was great, there was a good amount of flavour and the spices were not over done. For dessert, we had ice cream and tea. The tea was a bit sweet for our taste as we enjoy black tea.

While eating, the owner came out and made sure we were satisfied. He also shared his backstory which was refreshing to hear about. Overall, the service and their hospitality were great.

As for pricing, we were very surprised to see a $66 bill for 4 people dining out with a complete meal. You cant find fast food for that kind of price that we enjoyed so much food for.

5/5 would recommend this place."
Rayyan Restaurant,"Asalamualaykum,

This restaurant had such amazing service and food. We had them cater our Nikkah and everyone really enjoyed the food it was so so delicious and they gave such generous portions as well. They were very kind and easy to work with they made the experience so nice and they really handled catering such a big event so so well. You wont regret coming here for the amazing quality Somali food and even having them cater your next special event. May Allah place endless barrakah and khair in their business, such a wonderful experience."
Rayyan Restaurant,"It was fantastic,  the food was awesome...
The waiter had so much energy for his age, I Stan   .
Over all a good night out, I think we got our money's worth"
Rayyan Restaurant,"I ordered lamb dinner. While waiting for the main course, waiter served me a soup as an appetizer. The soup was  light, simple and very tasty. It really stimulates your sense of appetite and prepare you for the main course.  The lamb was well done and served with a sauce of perfect consistency and spices and aroma. Specially prepared basmati rice was served on the side . Also, as an additional side, you are given the option of a  jug of lemon or mango juice, as well as fruit, in my case a well ripened tasty banana. It also had a specially prepared hot sauce for individual liking. Moreover, it has free  three hours street parking right in front of the restaurant or on any street in the neighborhood. The appetizer,  juice and fruit were included in the price of the menu which I think is a good friendly jesture. Moreover,  I found staff very friendly and cheerful.  You get alot for your money. I will definitely be going back to Rayyan restaurant. I recommend."
Rayyan Restaurant,"Lunch today was amazing, very nice restaurant. Ugali, beef stew, lamb and rice. Super nice staff and the food is so so good."

Rayyan Restaurant,"We had a great time!!! so much food we almost exploded. You will not go home hungry

Rayyan Restaurant,Stopped in for lunch and had the whole deep fried fish with salad.  Best Ive had in a long time.  Very friendly service.  Will be back again very soon.
Rayyan Restaurant,"This is probably some of the best food you can get in Edmonton. Servings are delicious and plentiful. I would recommend for your self, friends and work lunches."
Rayyan Restaurant,"Really delicious Somalian food, probably the best In the city with minimal competition. We had the Beef, fish and steak with rice and they all were unique in their own way and also they have a great breakfast, The chief and his crew are Awesome!"

Rayyan Restaurant,"My favourite restaurant in Edmonton, friendly people best customer service"
Rayyan Restaurant,"I ordered the lamb shank, rice, side salad & chapati.  The aromatics that blessed my nose when I received the food was unreal; I knew I was in for a treat. The lamb was so tender, flavourful and juicy, literally the best Ive ever had.  The rice was fragrant with perfect consistency, and complimented the lamb so well. The chapati was light, flakey and generously sized. By far the best Somali restaurant in Edmonton 10/10."
Rayyan Restaurant,It was amazing you can taste all the flavours. They put work in it.
Rayyan Restaurant,This restaurant looks nice and clean. The food was on point
Rayyan Restaurant,"Great experience! Wonderful staff, amazing hospitality and service. I highly recommend Rayyan Restaurant, for anyone looking to eat real East African cuisine.

Rayyan Restaurant,"Amazing food, good quantity and absolutely worth the price! We ordered 8 dishes and they came within 10 minutes of ordering. Amazing service, everyone was so kind! They attended to our needs and gave us 3 free drink refills without us having to ask. They also offered us 6 different complimentary freshly made donuts with our african tea. Definitely planning on becoming regulars!"
Rayyan Restaurant,Great place and great food. I was there June 2 2023.
Rayyan Restaurant,"Ever since African Safari shut down my husband and I have been in search for the classic Kutalayte Beef (its deep fried steak with onions and rice). We came here because we saw that they have deep fried beef on the menu! We were greeted by the chef's son, Muhammad, who was very kind and knew exactly what we wanted. They gave us a big jug of mango juice as well lol and Chef Nur came out personally to thank us and it turns out he used to be the head chef at the old restauraunt! Great vibes here, large proportions, cheap prices too!! ??"
Rayyan Restaurant,"The food is always so good. Especially the whole grilled fish, and the shrimp too. The staff is always so kind and friendly. The price is fair for all the food you get. Every time I come to Edmonton I have to go here."
Rayyan Restaurant,"Very good:)
Prices are very reasonable!
Staff are friendly location is good."

The food was delicious and the serving sizes were generous. The server and chef were friendly and approachable and explained what some of the dishes were. I highly recommend a visit."
Rayyan Restaurant,Excellent food the best restaurant for East Africans community
Rayyan Restaurant,Had the lamb shoulder with pasta. Very tender and flavorful. Can't wait to come back when they have goat! Soup and juice was a nice touch
Rayyan Restaurant,Outstanding! Had Lamb Shank and my dining partner had the Chicken Steak. It's quality food at affordable prices. We ate in - super friendly. Lot's of Skip and Uber orders happening. This will quickly become the best Somali/Kenyan menu in all of Edmonton.
Rayyan Restaurant,"I was amazed to visit this restaurant, Honestly it gave a Home like feeling and i even mentioned it to the brother Mohammed there, Allhamdulilah, their Hospitality is the best. Couldn't have asked for more. Ofcourse to top that off, the food is really good.  They serve soup to start and with every main dish they serve really good lemonade or Mango Juice to chose from."
Rayyan Restaurant,The food is delicious! The fried fish is a must-have!! Will definitely be coming back for more.
Rayyan Restaurant,"I ate here a couple times.
The staff are friendly and welcoming.
The food is delicious."
Rayyan Restaurant,"Just went out for supper there with my husband, the waiter was very nice and friendly and the food portions were very generous. Food was delicious, we ordered barbeque chicken with rice as well as the beef muscle with rice. These also came with the delicious chicken soup which they served as soon as we sat down. It was definitely way more than we could finish and our server gave us some complementary chapati bread which was very delicious. I really really liked their spicy green hot sauce which they gave me extra to take home lol. They also brought us a mango cheesecake with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and another type of cake for my husband with some ice cream which was also very nice and generous of them and it was very delicious. What a very great time and experience and highly recommend to anyone to try."
Rayyan Restaurant,Great restaurant just north of Downtown. The food is healthy and delicious and the prices are incredibly low for what you get. Interesting dishes like goat and whole fried fish. The staff are also warm and friendly people. I highly recommend a visit here.
Rayyan Restaurant,Ive come here only 4 times but the food here is immaculate! Great service from all employees and I make sure to tip them every time for such a great job they do! I always order the chicken suquuar and it is the best Ive ever had. Food tastes amazing. 10/10 for everything!
Rayyan Restaurant,"I've been going to this restaurant for the past 5 months. I just love it. Very good food, plenty of beverages, and if you ask nicely, they have a special cheesecake banana dessert which you can't buy anywhere else. My top favorite entrees are the lamb shank, the breaded sugar chicken, and the salmon. The rice is very flavorful, and I liked the spaghetti too. I go out once in a while for very nice food. But what makes Rayyan special is that it's the any occasion restaurant. It's affordable to go every day, and has a nice area for more formal occasions. I've held family dinners here with my grandma and uncle's family. And I've also brought co-workers and managers. As of this writing, I am going there again on Nov 26, 2021 to celebrate the retirement of my previous boss. Thanks Nor!"
Rayyan Restaurant,"one of the best restaurants in edmonton, the breakfast is amazing"
Rayyan Restaurant,"My wife and I were picking up some takeout from the All Happy Restaurant that is next door for the kids when I saw the restaurant. I wanted to try something different so I told my wife to wait while I went to go check out the menu. I went to the front where a really nice fella helped me out. He showed me the menu and I picked out some grilled beef with some rice and mixed vegetables. He offered me a seat to wait for my order so I obliged. He brought me out a complimentary bowl of soup that was delicious. What a nice thing to do. My food was ready in ten minutes. I paid my bill and he inquired in a really welcoming way how I had heard of the restaurant so I told him it was just by chance. He spoke to me in a way that made me feel really welcomed at the restaurant. I got home and had the food and it was awesome. The rice was perfect and the beef and vegetables came in a nice gravy that mixed with the rice was just the kind of home cooked taste that I needed in my food. The service from the gentleman and the food made my day. Oh yeah and the price was great. I would suggest for anyone to check the place out. The service, food, and price will not disapoint."
Rayyan Restaurant,"The Owner Noor is a super guy.
The food was awesome. People need to try the goat,  Amazing."
Rayyan Restaurant,"My husband and I truly enjoyed dining at Rayyan and we encourage you to visit this lovely restaurant in Edmonton, Alberta. The service is unmatched. The staff truly cares about your experience, did not hesitate making my tea just the way I like it. The food is absolutely amazing, everything we tasted melted in our mouths. Absolutely the best meal we had while in Edmonton . Highly recommend!"
Rayyan Restaurant,"Delicious food, welcoming atmosphere, huge portion, reasonable price.  The staff is very kind, and willing to go the extra mile to assure that you have a satisfactory experience. Gotta say i was immensely surprised by the amount of professionalism that came  with this restaurant and the decor was off the charts. You don't have to wait around. From the moment you walked in,  you'll be directed to a table and a menu is presented immediately.  when you phone in, to order a pick up, the food is ready the moment you walk through the doors. it's not loud or crowded.  and like many Somalian restaurants the staff are not yelling over each other's heads. everyone that was not  eating had their mask on. COVID protocols were in place.   Overall i am most definitely  pleased with the restaurant, the food and the wonderful, amazing staff."
Rayyan Restaurant,"Where can I start.. I mean, everything about this restaurant is amazing! From the customer service to the food and atmosphere. The Chef goes above and beyond for his customers and brings out the most delicious food you'll ever taste from the East! The flavours of the food is out of this world and I would highly recommend everyone to try them out. All the staff are super friendly and accommodating, being a family run business they make you feel like you are part of their family too. Mohamed, Yusuf & Abu made sure I felt comfortable and were super friendly! Such lovely people and a beautiful well thought out restaurant. Thank you for a lovely service and will definitely be coming back!"
Rayyan Restaurant,My first time to try their menu.  It was all worth it.  Very appetizing. And we'll serve and really delicious.  And very clean restaurant
Rayyan Restaurant,Best food in the city mansha Allah??
Rayyan Restaurant,"I was a kind of skeptical at first . This ( Rayyan) is my absolute favorite restaurant in city. The food is always fantastic and no matter what I order.  I am always delighted with my meal! The servers is also excellent and very efficient, that  the owner comes once in a while and ask you if you need anything more. That's why I visit  at least three times a week. And wouldnt hesitate to recommend to anyone looking for somewhere to eat in.
?? RAYYAN RESTAURANT IS THE PLACE ?"
Rayyan Restaurant,The best food for ever good servers
Rayyan Restaurant,"If you are in need of some good EAST AFRICAN FOOD. It's the place to go. The chapatis are the best. The samosas Kenyan style stuffed with meat and hot pepper damn.(make the putter filling a little bit thick).

Rayyan Restaurant,"Having been kept by Covid from eating out as we used to, my wife and I got to do a lot of home cooking. We pretty much cut out going to restaurants. Because of that we became really picky the few times we went to a restaurant, or we bought take-out from one. We didnt want to eat in, or have take-out from, a so-so restaurant the few time we did either. One place, out of the very few, that has become our go-to restaurant for take-out, is Rayyan Restaurant, which is located in downtown Edmonton on 106 Avenue, just off 101 Street. The restaurant caters mostly Somali food. Were not new to restaurant Somali food. We used to help ourselves to it a lot but went off it for quite sometime. Then, not too too long ago, we happened to be driving along 101 Street across 106 Avenue when we spotted Rayyan Restaurant, which describes itself as serving East African food. We said, A new East African restaurant. I bet they serve Somali food. Lets try it out! We did and found the food to be better than much other Somali food we had had in the past  a variety of tasty, dishes in big portions served in a fast but friendly and professional manner. The owner, Noor, is engaging with a welcoming smile. He keeps a hands-on involvement on various tasks in the restaurants but still finds time for brief pleasant exchanges with customers. The restaurant operates 7 am to 10 pm, which means they must have lots of customers to be confident enough to be open for so many hours daily. Their confidence must come from their good food. We have tried mostly camel, lamb (shoulder and shank), beef, flavored rice and spaghetti, and chapati (flat bread); and all those dishes have been sumptuous. Rayyan also serves goat and chicken, which we havent try but plan to. They also serve breakfast, which we havent tried but we may just one day, out of curiosity. All in all, Rayyan is a Somali food restaurant I would recommend without hesitation to any one with a love for or curious about African food. Rayyan may be an excellent place for one to begin their African culinary journey."
Rayyan Restaurant,"I walked in after work and wow was I pleasantly surprised, the food is amazing as my first time trying East African food I will definitely recommend the pasta and meat option or soup which was 10 out of 10. The scenery is beautiful and very elegant while making me feeling at home another 10 out of 10. The icing on top was the service as the staff are super friendly and paid attention to all of my details 20 out of 10!!!!!"
Rayyan Restaurant,Amazing customer service and the best food. I really recommend this place to everyone.
Rayyan Restaurant,"This place was excellent! Provides excellent service, amazing portion sizes, the prices are reasonable, and the hospitality is immeasurable. Im glad I came!"

Rayyan Restaurant,"The food is amazing,service is the best so far I have gotten,it is a family owned restaurant and family oriented. You need to try it once but once you try it you will be addicted to their amazing food.????"
Rayyan Restaurant,"Combination of food qualities and extraordinary customer services are what I personally experienced from Rayyan Restaurant??. Big spaces, Seating layout, immaculateness, and well oriented atmosphere with interior decorations would be noticeable as you enter into Rayyan Restaurant. And definitely,  getting warmest reception from its well trained/mindful employees would make you even more comfortable. I won't be shy to say that I've tried most of Rayyan Restaurant's menu and kept going back every week twice or more. I highly recommend my fellow edmontonians and visitors in our beloved city to pay a visit at Rayyan Restaurant.  Delivery is also available experiencing its delicious variety of dishes. You can view its manu online as well.

Rayyan Restaurant,"I ordered from Uber eats and noticed they charged a 13% tax instead of 5%. Contacted Uber and was told that tax rate is determined by the restaurant. This is outright fraud from this restaurant! Guys check your receipts, not sure if they also charge 13% tax for dine in orders.

Also, their lamb shank is bone dry, not a drop of gravy."

Koultures Afro-Continental Restaurant,"Goat meat was tough and flavourless, the enormous pile of hard and dry jollof tasted scorched and the plantain bland and not sweet at all. And they started blaring church music which we had to ask to turn it down. Just terrible."
Koultures Afro-Continental Restaurant,"Please do not waste your money to go dine or order from this restaurant. The Nigerian food are made by Ethiopians who do not even know how to cook west African cuisines or Nigerian food for that matter. I ordered a jollof rice on Uber eats and the rice came dry and tasteless. The former owners of this restaurant use to be Nigerians and their food use to taste good back then but since these recent Ethiopian owners have taken over now, the Nigerian food tastes like garbage. They charge ppl a lot of money for this type of garbage they call food when it doesnt even taste good. This is not how a Nigerian jollof rice taste like. Please stick to cooking Ethiopian foods or hire an actual west African who knows how to cook Nigerian food and stop serving us this garbage you call a jollof rice when it tastes nothing like the real jollof rice."
Koultures Afro-Continental Restaurant,"Great food! Loved the fufu with the egusi and beef. Ordered a side of plantain and also had the Jollof rice with curry chicken and plantain. The atmosphere was quiet, aside from the history of Spain documentary playing in the background. The service was a bit slow, but I think that was just due to the low amount of staff. The prices were also quite high, and when we requested water, we were brought a bottled water ($2) rather than a glass of water (free). Other than that, it was great and felt like elevated home cooking - which is always a great thing!"
Koultures Afro-Continental Restaurant,"Nice to see, eat, drink and much more in this restaurant, so welcome personal and good dishes ??"
Koultures Afro-Continental Restaurant,"My husband and I ventured out for date night and found an amazing food experience!! Flavors where out the door good!! Service very friendly and accommodating! We definitely will be making this little restaurant a regular date night spot! Thank you, we really enjoyed our meal!"
Koultures Afro-Continental Restaurant,The food was very delicious and there is a lot of different choices. If you love Nigerian food this is the place to go!
Koultures Afro-Continental Restaurant,"I had avoided coming to this place because of the bad reviews when it comes to Nigerian food. I gave it a try today, the egusi soup only had dried tasteless beef, tastes nothing like egusi  soup, had to put raw salt on the food and the fufu was terrible . Spent 47$ for such a small terrinle portion. Please avoid this place trust me."
Koultures Afro-Continental Restaurant,"We were originally going to go to another restaurant this Saturday over the Easter long weekend, but it was closed. As Koultures was opened, we thought we would give it a try. The service was slow and not as good as I would expect from a ""fine dining"" restaurant (as advertised on their sign).  The food however was delicious and authentic.  I would definitely go back."
Koultures Afro-Continental Restaurant,"Ive driven by this place numerous times and decided to stop in here for dinner with my girlfriend. The restaurant was quite large with modern fixtures mixed with some authentic African decor. The menu was multiple pages and had lots to offer all dietary restrictions but does cater more to those who like meat. The girlfriend ordered lamb tibs while I ordered the shiro wot, and both were accompanied by a side of ingera. The lamb dish spicy, savoury and filling. The shiro wot (chickpea stew) came out piping hot in a bowl and it had a savoury but sweet flavour. Its hard to explain but absolutely delicious. The pictures attached seem like the portions are small due to the large plate of ingera but the girlfriend packed leftovers to go, while I finished my dish while completely satisfied. Service was a bit slow as they were short staffed but overall a great place for authentic African cuisine and definitely would recommend it to friends."
Koultures Afro-Continental Restaurant,This is honestly one of my best food experiences in my life. I have never had this flavour and taste in my mouth before. Hundreds of seductive flavours in my mouth all over me Im eating right now as we speak so good.
Koultures Afro-Continental Restaurant,"Egusi Soup with Goat Meat and Pounded Yam. Suya beef is Spicy, delicious and full of flavour.
The Jollof Rice is on point as well.

Authentic Nigerian food at its finest. One of my favourite restaurants in Edmonton. I drive 30 mins all the way from the deep Southwest of the city just to eat here.

I wish I took more photos. Sorry folks.

You will love this food."
Koultures Afro-Continental Restaurant,"Service needs help - welcome guests, offer a drink. Menu could be updated. Up the branding game. Food portions were large and we did not get to wait too long unlike what other reviews read. This place has great potential - good luck guys. Put yourselves on the map as an African restaurant. Listen to your customers - I believe they are loyal and want the best for you."
Koultures Afro-Continental Restaurant,"The greediest little restaurant ever, my friend paid $60 for two meals over priced considering and okra sauce barely covered the bottom of the tray,  drinks not included, there debit machine automatically adds a tip regardless of the fact they skim you on every item.  Don't waste your money here. Owner protested about adding hot sauce. ?????? I wish it wasn't this bad."
Koultures Afro-Continental Restaurant,"Restaurant is nice. Service could be improved. Only one person running both orders and kitchen so makes it slow sometimes. Overall, Its good."
Koultures Afro-Continental Restaurant,"Amazing Ethiopian food  with great service. Koultures especial is a Must!!!
If you love a good coffee don't forget to order some Buna(coffee)"
Koultures Afro-Continental Restaurant,"Delicious food! The chicken was so perfectly cooked it fell off the bone, and we ordered the Koultures Special which was the best lamb I've ever had with cheese and spicy ground beef. Injera was so soft and fresh."
Koultures Afro-Continental Restaurant,Went here for some Ethiopian food and the food was good. It took over an hour before the food came out and when it was time to pay they charged me $10 more than the price on the menu. It's a hit or miss kind of place
Koultures Afro-Continental Restaurant,Asked for non spicy. Recieved an extremely spicy dish. Would have preferred a refund if they felt like they could not deliver a non spicy item. Had to throw the meal in the garbage.  Waste of 30$.
Koultures Afro-Continental Restaurant,I bought pepper soup tilapia and GOAT and I got water and tasteless GOAT and tilapia. I called and the lady at the shop was apologetic about it but never should you try and buy this from them.
Koultures Afro-Continental Restaurant,Stop spoiling West African food. Better hire chefs ????? from there who know how to prepare the food.
Koultures Afro-Continental Restaurant,"The food is ridiculously expensive. Apart from that, the food portion does not reflect the price. The other day, I bought pounded yam and Egusi soup. The soup was so small and I requested for a little more soup to be added. They told me I have to pay an extra 10$ to get more soup.

It's unfortunate that I don't have pictures anymore but one thing is for sure, I'm never going back to that place."
Koultures Afro-Continental Restaurant,Great food! Loved my meal and will be returning come hungry the plates are big!
Koultures Afro-Continental Restaurant,Waiting time is horrible. It took them 2hrs to deliver my food then they suggested that I should come pick it up myself. The food was horrible and too much palm oil. Please reduce oil. Spinach stew(efo riro) meat was missing inside. Only smoked dry fish which tasted very bad . When the food was delivered it was cold.
Koultures Afro-Continental Restaurant,"A Very relaxed atmosphere and the food was Absolutely delicious! I had the Pounded Yam (fufu) & Soup along with the King Fish and Jollof Rice. I really enjoyed my meal and would recommend Koultures for anyone interested in trying/wanting Nigerian or Ethiopia cuisine.

Next visit I will try another entrée from their menu but I will most likely get the pounded yam & Soup everytime as a starter."
Koultures Afro-Continental Restaurant,The place is beautiful and food taste really good????
Koultures Afro-Continental Restaurant,"I visited this restaurant with my friends yesterday and was it such an experience! Great music, great communication, awesome reception, cozy ambience! I lovedddd the ambience there!

Nobody complained when we laughed so loud, like, all through the meal or talked loud! The table server was such a courteous person! I wish I got his name so that I could thank him here. But we will definitely be going there again!! And again, and again!!

Now, the food. I had Jollof Rice. It was packed with flavour. Amazing food! It was my first experience with an African cuisine and boy oh boy it was worth!

The lighting, paintings displayed on walls, oh the total ambience!

This place is a must visit. Go there NOW!"
Koultures Afro-Continental Restaurant,"You order in advance to pick up at a certain time and when you arrive at that said time, youre stared at like you make no sense. It took two people to figure out what I ordered IN ADVANCE on DoorDash. I ordered in advance by 1.5 hours to avoid waiting cause they never have anything ready on time. Then I had to wait almost 45 minutes to receive the order. The food was so poorly packaged, 50% of the soup spilled out cause they used very flimsy containers. You ask for mild and they make it as spicy as they want.

Ive been here several times hoping each time theres is improvement but the customer service is zero. Poor attitudes, extra charges, longest wait and no acknowledgment of the customer. Plus, dirty looks while youre waiting or as youre paying. Ridiculous!"
Koultures Afro-Continental Restaurant,"Been there twice and will go back many more times!
The service is not the fastest, but they are friendly and welcoming. Also keep in mind good food takes time to prepare.
I'm new to African food in general so I wasnt sure what to expect. The food was spectacular! I have no idea what most of it was but it was so flavorful and fresh. Their veggie platter is a must have. I also got a sizzling fried beef dish that I could not stop eating. The complimentary desert was also much appreciated! The price was worth it for the portions we received. I had to loosen my belt and waddle out of the restaurant with a big smile on my face. Worth a visit!"
Koultures Afro-Continental Restaurant,"I love the Suya Meat , its all I really go for and I do delivery every time. I love this particular dish but cant speak on anything else. The interaction with the employees was pretty basic ordered my food and left. Suya is delicious ??"
Koultures Afro-Continental Restaurant,The fufu with the Nigerian veggie soup from there is my fav so far 10/10 its so goood and super filling?? I ordered it again rn on ubereats
Koultures Afro-Continental Restaurant,"What a rip off. We order a couple of there dishes online for delivery which included goat stew combo, 30 minutes after placing the order they called to inform they didn't have the side dish we had ordered so they suggested a beverage for replacement which happened to be way less valued/priced than the original item. Then we didn't get the goat combo but rather some tasteless beef stew. And to top it off my boyfriend got food poisoning from his order. So much for cravings, never again!"
Koultures Afro-Continental Restaurant,Nah do you know how mad I gotta be to be typing this up at 11pm but hands down one of the worst food experience Ive had in my entire life. Order food for 4 people and only got one order. And they charged me 65 dollars. Please I beg dont order from this place they are scamming. Enough said. Have a good night everyone expect the people that either make the food here or deliver it. One of all owe me money or food Ill take either.
Koultures Afro-Continental Restaurant,"Last night I ordered the Egusi soup (with beef) and pounded yam. When I say that the flavour in this food almost knocked me over, Im not kidding. The Egusi was packed with flavour and had a very pleasant kick, but wasnt so spicy that it was inedible. The pounded yam was the perfect consistency to eat the meal with and was not over spiced or seasoned which would take away the flavour or the soup.

The beef in the Egusi was admittedly a little bit dry, but the flavour of it completely compensated for this. I will definitely order from this restaurant again."
Koultures Afro-Continental Restaurant,"This restaurant is the worst in Edmonton, the wait time is forever. The stuff is very rude and ignores you when you ask where your food is. Is amazing they are still open. We waited for over and hour and when we asked where our food was we were asked to just leave. Disrespectful."
Koultures Afro-Continental Restaurant,"Food was excellent and a great price for what you get. It came within a good time as well, although the two dishes didn't come at once.

Service was friendly but far more casual than I expected for a place that looks like its fine dining, and a little slow.

Disappointed that much of their vegetarian options have been removed from the menu and it would be great if they had a drink menu to order from."
Koultures Afro-Continental Restaurant,"I recommend the restaurant!!! The service, food everything was amazing!!!"
Koultures Afro-Continental Restaurant,I had their jollof and it was great. Portion sizes were great and the food was fresh. They have a really mixed menu with west and East African cuisines which is sure to appease everyone. Definitely recommend
Koultures Afro-Continental Restaurant,"Customer service isnt good at all. Called in to complain that the quality of food dropped for my last order and her response was that shes busy and cant talk now.
Anyways, you have lost a customer."
Koultures Afro-Continental Restaurant,"I am generous with Asian single star rating, service was far below expectations. Food was served incorrectly after a long delay, I was incorrectly billed and almost made to pay for what I did not eat, the server got angry when I gave him my honest feedback. I do not wish any other person to go through my experience. I went there with my family visiting Edmonton, we were all disappointed"
Koultures Afro-Continental Restaurant,"We ordered the Nigerian dish with fufu and egusi. $24 and it wasnt as good as we thought.. also the portion was sooooo small... Expected much more for the price. The assorted meat was just tendon and pork skin...
Also ordered the rice that had 4 giant pieces of HARD beef..

Was very unimpressed with the expensive pricing for so little..
would not order again or recommend to friends."
Koultures Afro-Continental Restaurant,"The stars are deff for the food. Suya beef 100% love it!
I usually have trouble ordering over the phone...but the food was delicious. Crunchy meat and well seasoned! Will be back :)"
Koultures Afro-Continental Restaurant,"As a tourist in Edmonton, longing for a taste of Nigerian or at least food, it was enough to read online about a restaurant that serves ""West African"" food. But to get to Koultures and find it was actually Nigerian food was exciting!

My family and I eagerly looked forward to the meals, hoping they would be close to Nigerian taste. Boy, were we so wrong! It wasn't close, it was a great hit on the bull's eye!!! The handsome, amiable and unassuming chef totally nailed it! Nigeria came alive in the heart of Edmonton!

The dishes were so fantastically prepared, and this is coming from someone who is not only particular about food being well prepared, but one who cooks too! The portions were delightfully generous, we were certain we would have several packs of food to go home with, but the food was way too tasty that we struggled to go home with barely anything!

Going to Koultures was one of the highlights of this trip for my family. We would definitely recommend Koultures to anyone who loves great food in a welcoming environment served by wonderful people with an altogether beautiful disposition!"
Koultures Afro-Continental Restaurant,lm very not so happy and not pleased with the service on this place Is like I wasted my money (40$) on this foods i ordered two things which is not hard to forget I asked for pepper soup fish and nigeria jollof rice. that rice didnt even tasted like jollof. My fish wasnt even pepper soup but sending me fry fish like huh ? The whole reason I even ordered is because I saw pepper soup really disappointed !!!!!!!
Koultures Afro-Continental Restaurant,"The restaurants environment its self is  decidedly engaging,  beautiful decorated, and clean. Koultures menu is colourful with ethnic dishes from Ethiopia and Nigeria to suit any palette.
BUT
The food takes a ridiculously long time to arrive. When I ordered I waited over an hour for an APPETIZER and when it arrived it was the wrong order, now I couldve asked to send it back but I didnt see the point as it wouldve taken another hour for the order to arrive."
Koultures Afro-Continental Restaurant,Food Service and customer service are poor. They say they cater to Nigerians and ethiopians but they really cater for the ethiopians. And they take a long time to bring the order. They don't do substitutions. If they run out of a side dish you will pay full price if you don't mention something in place of the missing items. I would suggest to go somewhere else.
Koultures Afro-Continental Restaurant,"Tonight I had the egusi with goat, fufu & jollof rice. Everything tasted wonderful and the service was amazing! I will definitely be back"
Koultures Afro-Continental Restaurant,"Terrible service that matches the bad food. We waited over an hour for our meal. They totally forgot the coffee I ordered, it was almost impossible to get a waitress. when the food finally came out it was so underwhelming. The beans were either too spicy or not spicy enough . The lamb was under cooked. The rice and vegetables plain. They didn't have any of the coffee drinks on their menu other than basic filter coffee. We were so disappointed from the food that took extremely too long to show up."
Koultures Afro-Continental Restaurant,"I came here for the first time almost two weeks ago and really enjoyed the vegetarian combo. The shiro wat and misir wat were excellent! ?????? I look forward to coming again. Next time, I will try some of the Nigerian dishes! ??"
Koultures Afro-Continental Restaurant,"Food was good but I didn't like the fact that towards the end of my meal, the place was filled with some kind of smoke/incense that was intentionally diffused for the pleasure of other customers..  I had to leave the place in a hurry after that. Please consider the comfort of ALL  your guests. I loved the music though."
Koultures Afro-Continental Restaurant,"Great choice of Ethiopian and Nigerian food,  taste is amazing and staff are friendly. Good choice for a quick lunch or dinner that does not require dressing up and vibe is more upbeat with latest hits playing in the background. I especially recommend for the Nigerian dishes."
Koultures Afro-Continental Restaurant,"Went there for the first time tonight and loved it! Excellent food, friendly and informative service, a casually quiet non-rushed dining experience. We were able to have a great conversation, eat with our hands, and enjoy a lovely coffee after (which they roast and bring the beans to the table for you to sleep!) This place should definitely be busier!"
Koultures Afro-Continental Restaurant,Thank you for accommodating all 15 of  us. We came all the way from Toronto for this amazing home experience. We will be back
Koultures Afro-Continental Restaurant,"Bad service, trash food. As a matter of fact, they don't deserve 1 star. I simply asked a lady on phone if my order will be ready in 15 minutes, and she snapped and told me in a very rude way that she was busy. Made me wonder if i was going to pay for her services or not. They also served me burnt tilapia fish twice."
Koultures Afro-Continental Restaurant,"This  restaurant is the worst restaurant Ive ever been too  . we waited for one hour and decided to leave after ,  they didnt even apologize to us  . I will not recommend this restaurant to anyone, dont waste your time ."
Koultures Afro-Continental Restaurant,"I recently had the most amazing meal there with some colleagues from the office. Goat meat, rice, spinach and fufu. All prepared promptly and delicious. It tasted just like home. I am going there tomorrow again. Does anyone want to join me?"
Koultures Afro-Continental Restaurant,I gave a 5 star even though it was my first time there yesterday. The food and service was excellent although I couldnt get my small chops cause the kitchen had closed by the time I got there??.. All the same excellent place to eat and listen to Nigeria songs which reminds me of home ??. One more thing if you can get online delivery that will be great
Koultures Afro-Continental Restaurant,"We really enjoyed the Ethiopian cultural spicy food. Beside that  the typical Ethiopian instrumental music brought me old memories from back home.
Keep it up!"
Koultures Afro-Continental Restaurant,"Nice warm African delicacies, prepared fresh so you have to wait between 15 to 20minutes to get served. But you can reduce the waiting time by calling ahead to place your order before arriving the restaurant. Also plays current Nigerian Music."
Koultures Afro-Continental Restaurant,"The food is alright but the guy we met today was just rude as he'll, the air quality in there was terrible and when we mentioned it to him he got salty and was rude. He was even choking funny enough, not a place for people with respiratory problems. Terrible service today ?? very unimpressed tsk tsk."
Koultures Afro-Continental Restaurant,Scam. Cheat. Inedible
Koultures Afro-Continental Restaurant,"Food was delicious but portion were ever small as if they were feeding birds. Very disappointed!!!
Ordered online and was missing an order.
Please work on your customer service and PORTION!!!!!!! 24 bucks for literally nothing on your plate!"
Koultures Afro-Continental Restaurant,"Selection is amazing.  The food was delicious.  Having never tried Nigerian food, I asked for recommendations. The lady who helped selected a great meal."
Koultures Afro-Continental Restaurant,"They may be great with other African meals but the Nigerian dishes are not worth it. Also, I was charged $25 for a plate of food that had no meat. Terrible!"
Koultures Afro-Continental Restaurant,"Said its open 10am on sundays posted on their door however I followed the 12pm open time on Sundays on Google. Arrive at 12:30 today and closed up, completely dark inside."
Koultures Afro-Continental Restaurant,"The experience here was good, the food is good but the prices are too high."
Koultures Afro-Continental Restaurant,What a bad experience we had! We came in and not even a hello or anything we then asked to see the menu and the guy just stared doesnt offer us to sit down or anything we then were deciding it was 6:30pm and he goes look I close at 8pm! The service was so bad and we felt so unwelcomed that we left! Strongly recommend not going here if your looking to even get serviced what a huge disappointment!
Koultures Afro-Continental Restaurant,"Wonderful place and if you haven't tried African food you should do it here. Food was very good, made with fresh ingredients and the restaraunt and bathrooms were very clean. Our server David was excellent."
Koultures Afro-Continental Restaurant,"We ordered on three different occasions and each time our order was wrong. Last time I visited there I requested receipt for my meal, the waiter said to me we run out of paper. I cant give u receipt ""take the food or leave it""."
Koultures Afro-Continental Restaurant,I love ordering at koultures because its absolutely delicious but they barely pick up peoples calls and my skip the dishes orders are always canceled ??.
Koultures Afro-Continental Restaurant,"I think this place is one of the decent Dinning ethiopian and  eritrean Restaurants in town . The place is clean , well decorated and very bright . The food was delicious.  I enjoyed dinning there . The server (Nina ) was kind of shy , however she  did her best . .. i would recommend to anyone"
Koultures Afro-Continental Restaurant,"I was in Edmonton during the weekend, and I was starving for an African food. I met an Uber driver that took me to this restaurant outside the university hospital I was staying. The food here was fantastic and the palmy was too good. I met the cook Chukwudi - a young promising man, and the Ethiopian madam. They were professional with there services , and I had wished for a similar restaurant like this one in Prince George, BC. Thank you guys and hope to see you again on my way to Saskatchewan."
Koultures Afro-Continental Restaurant,"Good waiters, lively atmosphere. Decent meal for the first few times we came, but things got ruined on the 3rd visit with sour rice dishes. Dissappointed."
Koultures Afro-Continental Restaurant,I went to this place today and we waited 1 hour for our food which was fine with us because we love their food. They didnt offer drinks and ignored us when we asked for water. Service was terrible. They should hire more people to serve.
Koultures Afro-Continental Restaurant,"Took THREE HOURS to get our order food was average, however I do not recommend"
Koultures Afro-Continental Restaurant,"As In, omo mehn. It has been long since I have had Naija food sha. Anyhow. It was a rainy day that day, so Nigerian pepper soup was a good idea at the time. When we got to Koultures, they served us pepper soup in a calabash. It brought the African feel, and it tasted great too. And the Jollof rice made sense too. Good stuff. Did I also mention that the restaurant looks good. Red tablecloths, and such."
Koultures Afro-Continental Restaurant,Ate some goat meat and got a nice tuggy out back. Will be coming back soon
Koultures Afro-Continental Restaurant,The Jollof rice with  goat meat was great
Koultures Afro-Continental Restaurant,"now this place is something different if u have never tried any Ethiopian or Eritrean cultural food, this is the place to go, everything you eat there is Organic and freshly made and they serve it hot and you start kicking it, and if u can't finish it u can take it home, warm it and again indulge it and it still tests fresh, and they serve spicy and non spicy. go and try something new."
Koultures Afro-Continental Restaurant,"Service was great and the food was really natural and delicious!
I highly recommend this superb restaurant, if you really want to taste
great food with amazing services !"
Koultures Afro-Continental Restaurant,Your food taste good but apparently the price is unnecessarily expensive compared to the same bowl of rice and few piece of beef in other african and Chinese restaurants
Koultures Afro-Continental Restaurant,"Had lunch at this restaurant for the first time.  It was very good, the food was delicious, the restaurant was clean, The attendant Christine was very pleasant and help me to choose what I wanted to eat. It was a pleasant experience."
Koultures Afro-Continental Restaurant,"Good customer and food services. I enjoyed my meal. I ordered for poundo yam with vegetables and egusi, moinmoin, plantain, goatmeat, assorted meat, tilapia fish and pepper soup for my family."
Koultures Afro-Continental Restaurant,"Food is not worth how much they charge, ordered food for $60 I literally got 20 bucks worth of food, they are charging $16 for a whole talapia but then charge $16 only for one slice of king fish? Yeah last time for me"
Koultures Afro-Continental Restaurant,The best ethiopian food ive ever had! The food and drinks came quick. Customer service is great as well. Highly recommend!
Koultures Afro-Continental Restaurant,The food was a little slow and the decor is... interesting (bright neon pink on black!) but the food tastes delicious! We'll definitely be back.
Koultures Afro-Continental Restaurant,should specify if there is pork in a meal because its a very common dietary restriction. specify in general what youre selling.
Koultures Afro-Continental Restaurant,"The food was delicious!

Will definitely visit again."
Koultures Afro-Continental Restaurant,The food is delicious I tried both east and west African dishes I highly recommend this place koultres restaurant.??????????

Afrocart,"I should actually give a zero!unfortunately the system do not allow it. I ordered almost a month again malta guiness and fanta, called several times, I was very patient because I was thinking let's support african business.

I received Maltex instead of malta guiness I was never asked if I was ok with my drink being changed. 1 fanta is half full. Glass bottle not bubbles wrapped. See pictures attached. I AM really disappointed, never again. I ordered there because of malta guiness, I had a bad customer service and no malta guiness and less money in my account. ShAME"
Afrocart,"Great customer service and adaptability to customer demand. Also Stephen (one of the cofounders) is super reliable, and the team does their best to deliver. Reading some of the prior reviews and I'll say mistakes could sometimes happen especially in logistics, but I've seen them grow Afro-cart over time despite starting it as students. 100% recommend for African online grocery shopping"
Afrocart,Good customer service and fast shipping. Had a bit of issues but l appreciate the way everything was handled by the support team. Totally recommend. Thanks to Stephen for following up and great customer service.

Afrocart,"I wish I had read the reviews earlier :(

Do not purchase from these folks. Almost 2 weeks later, my order has still not shipped, there has been zero communication about what is happening, not even a message saying X is not in stock but we can send you Y. I asked for an update and 5 days later no word.

We all want to support African businesses, but there is no evidence these guys are legitimate."

African Freshness Superstore,"When I moved to Canada, I was concerned about how to prepare my home-cooked Nigerian dishes due to a lack of ingredients.This comes from someone who adores  home-cooked Nigerian food. The African Freshness Store, on the other hand, had everything I needed, including my hair products, and the greatest part was that I had a large range to choose from.I could even purchase in bulk for huge households.Furthermore, the prices are reasonable given that most of the things are not easily found locally. This store is the best I've seen in Canada, and the personnel are very friendly, so I definitely recommend it."
African Freshness Superstore,"I wish I could give -minus  zero , this place services at the meat shop is the worst , today I went to buy meat and 2 guys just look at me and continue working . I forget to add that I am West Indian , African men walk up to the counter and he was serve right away . This happen to me 2 times at this store. I will never step back in that store .  I was trying to respond to your comment , I was in your store around 12:50 , I say the meat area the services is bad , if he didnt help me , why would I buy something else. I love how you reply to my comment / review . But the services in the store is bad . I wish they were fast like that . Thank you . I have no reason to lie , about it . I believe it important to leave reviews so people can see how workers are . I hope you trained them on customers services ."
African Freshness Superstore,This is by far the biggest grocery store in the city. The variety they give at reasonable prices is heartwarming. The music and the items from Nigeria I have so much missed ????
African Freshness Superstore,This stores is gradually loosing the warm customer service there are known for in the days of Danforth road. There is a reason the store was my favourite African store till recently. I had a sour experience with the owner recently and I wish they work on their customer service.
African Freshness Superstore,"A very good place for all your food items, African food especially. It is located in an accessible area in Lawrence Avenue"
African Freshness Superstore,"I will rate this store 5star, because it has different varieties of African produce and they are easy to access."
African Freshness Superstore,"Every time I goes there they over charged me. The price you see on products   in the shelf is not the same to what they charged by the cashier.
Maybe its because i am not nigarian. After today I won't go back to the store."
African Freshness Superstore,"It's a really big store and they have a great variety of African and especially Nigerian food items, African fabric, hair products etc. I was amazed to see some typical traditional Igbo musical instruments like metal gong, wooden gong, local flute aka oja, and even nchorokoto(local games)?? they also have Tapioca(oh how I've missed this cereal)????
There's parking space too, courteous staff and their prices are relatively ok.
They have a great deal of stuff available, very organized and neat??
I'll definitely buy more from them, going forward...."
African Freshness Superstore,"I'm not the type that leaves negative reviews, but the guy at the meat section got me doing this. I'm a regular customer of this store and I travel to buy my groceries there all the way from Oshawa because I buy things in bulk. I previously purchased a box of chicken which wasn't cut the way I would like them cut and ever since I have my own reservation and would like them cut right in front of me. On this day, the guy refused and was adamant that I either take the pre-cut chicken or nothing, I tried to be understanding by telling him to show me a piece and then I would decide if I'm okay with it and he said I can open the box myself and check it if I like. I found this so disrespectful! He was actually getting into a heated argument with me and I thought it's best I leave the store. The owners of this store have a great personality but I believe it's high time they started looking into their employees attitude as well because if not guided, they might bring down their business! Ire o."
African Freshness Superstore,"Big African store , looks like they have everything African. Bigger than all the Ghana /Nigerian stores Ive been  and customer service was good ????"
African Freshness Superstore,Love this African store  its so big with fresh goodies and good customer service
African Freshness Superstore,"The best Afro-Caribbean store in Ontario, where you can buy fresh meat, fish, vegetables, all sorts of Afro-Caribbean spices, food, and drinks. Please check it out and confirm by yourself."
African Freshness Superstore,Best best African supply store in Scarborough! Prices are reasonable and quality of food is amazingggg!!
African Freshness Superstore,"So I came here to buy goat meat, but after seeing one of the butchers literally throw frozen meat on the ground to break it up, then tossed them into the sink, I had to walk out. Super unsanitary and gross. I don't know where they took their food handling courses, but this is not how you handle meat. Just a side note and update to the owners response. He took the plastic off so it was meat against the floor. I get throwing frozen meat in a bag to break it up, but he took the bag off and was tossing the meat directly on the floor."
African Freshness Superstore,You'll find practically all your Nigerian foodstuff and other items needs met here. Staff are also nice and friendly. Pricing is fair and competitive enough. Free parking is also really accessible within and around vicinity.
African Freshness Superstore,Youre definitely going to get what you came looking for. Great store
African Freshness Superstore,"My first visit and it was a lovely experience. There was a very kind lady who helped me with my shopping needs and ensured I had great success preparing for an upcoming special meal. The butcher was so kind and dear to me offering me suggestions. He was very kind as well.
The store is well laid out and have endless products. I give kudos for the upkeep and professionalism they demonstrated.
Whatever it is that you are looking for, they have it. Worth the extra driving for the quality and customer service.

Thank you so much!"
African Freshness Superstore,"They have a wide variety of African produce and products. The owners and staff pleasant, the atmosphere friendly. Had a great shopping experience."
African Freshness Superstore,They have everything Nigerian and Carribean and their customer service is top notch. And the prices are reasonable. This is where I will always shop. Satisfied Customer
African Freshness Superstore,"Very clean and nice grocery store, they have a lot of varieties but their only problem is the man at the meat section, he is so disrespectful even when youre there being calm and polite. I hope he turns a new leaf this year Cos I definitely stopped going to the store because of the him, not everyone can tolerate Disrespect especially when you turn it to a habit. He is rude every-time and I cant stand there to exchange words with him only Cos hes an elderly man, i hope he works on his ego issues this year Cos he is definitely doing a kind of job that humbles people but hes out there trying to show/prove himself to people when theyre not even looking down on him in the first place, if he cannot do the job just give the opportunity to someone else. His manner of approach is terrible and he gossips about customers to each other, I hope the management looks into it."
African Freshness Superstore,"Great store for all things African and more, amazing service by the staff"
African Freshness Superstore,"I newly come from Montreal, and since I discover this place, I start feeling more confortable, especially because they sell my favourite vegetable wich is african basilic (esru). And I do love yams. Thanks for keeping closer to us our african foods. Although it's far from my place (unless you have over stores in the city), I'll definitely keep going there."
African Freshness Superstore,"They sell the best Products, have nice and friendly workers. You get the best of all you want."
African Freshness Superstore,Ooh. I love the store so much... I go there every week and the personnels are so friendly
African Freshness Superstore,"They sell very clean vegetables and meat. I feel more healthy since i started getting my grocery here. Highly recommended. The owners are amazing people also; their customer services skill is great but they need to have a talk with their employee, she's always frowning. I hope she doesn't chase the customers away."
African Freshness Superstore,Best place to get Africa food stuff
African Freshness Superstore,"I just left this supermarket and you wouldn't believe there were 3 other people waiting to pay for items and the lady was so focused on helping a guy do his shopping that she didn't even acknowledge us, the customers waiting to pay for our items.
If I may suggest,  acknowledge your customers, having a store in Canada means you are serving customers who are Nigerians and non Nigerians. You are not the only African store in Scarborough. People have options and would like to support you but when you don't acknowledge customers,  you keep them waiting like they have nothing to  do with their time then expect no one to support you.
All I ask is that you do better with your customer service because you do have a lot of potential as a business.  Also with the renovations going on in your store try to keep it tidy. It's a mess and a health and safety hazard.
I also understand that it's a husband and wife that own the store, but this is where as business owners you hire a staff to help customers or multitask.  When I'm going home after a long day at work, I want to quickly grab the few things that I need,  pay and go home.  I don't want to stand there for 20minutes, not being acknowledged or cared for. Treat customers better and more business will come. All the best"
African Freshness Superstore,Great place to buy all Nigerian/Ghanaian foodstuffs. Exceed expectations! The best in Toronto and beyond.
African Freshness Superstore,"Very friendly couple. The lady goes above and beyond to get one what they need if they don't have it. She helps promotes her customers businesses by word of mouth, flyers and cards. They were the first African store to have a sale. In 2019,they had a half off sale for garri/cassava meal. That my friend; was impressive. One of their assistant however, ?? you would love her; if you like to enjoy the Nigerian market woman experience. She is graceful so."
African Freshness Superstore,"I dont know why anyone would say anything negative about anyone here. The woman here is nice..very nice and pleasant. The husband too. Very warm, both of them . And the place is well stocked.  Not sure there is anything from home that you cant get here . My son saw bottled fanta the other day and was extremely excited. Sure they come at a 'price' but if u need to feel 'at home' come here!

I bought a certain dried fish...very affordable and it is so good with vegetables. Made the best soup with it.

Lovely service all the time and she gave us
free onions too! And again free meat !

African Freshness Superstore,Great variety of Nigerian food items.
African Freshness Superstore,I was looking for a new African food store in the GTA and a friend suggested this one to me. The store had all the food basics you would need but still kept a wide variety. They even had many interesting hair products! Beautiful braid colors and crochet options. Will definitely be coming back.
African Freshness Superstore,"Very neat place, with a lit of items in stock. They seem cheap too. They're honest; they will advise you on how best to save money on what you buy, and how to identify a product that is going to expire. Excellent folks."
African Freshness Superstore,They're all great staff with the common vision of increasing sales.
African Freshness Superstore,"Provided a lot of good ethic spices. I was at my wits end trying to find alligator pepper at my local grocery store, I'm glad inwas able to find all my favorite spices. Will be returning again!"
African Freshness Superstore,"It's a one stop for all your African recipes, the couple are very pleasant and respectful. The staffs have great customer service as well,  the jamaican lady is very welcoming??"
African Freshness Superstore,"This has got to be the worse African store in Canada. I wanted chicken and they blatantly refused to give the chicken to the uber to deliver. They said I must come into store myself. In this times of pandemic and the government trying to keep people apart, this store is forcing people to come in  store to get their groceries. I will be reporting this store to the ontario hotline and have them call the store and make an order n get proof."
African Freshness Superstore,"Very bad customer service  and sometimes the owner don't explain things to customers. I rather go to Jane at west end to buy my stuff or simi shop that has good customer service,  I live in Scarborough but I rather go to west end"

The South African Store,"If youre looking for special freaking things, give me the shot youre not gonna regret it

Love this little store that sells food and snacks you dont see often in supermarkets. This beef biltong is so good, its addictive! Im never eating those commercially sold beef jerky anymore!"
The South African Store,"If your looking for some South African grocery, I think you've found the place. This place has an assortment of unique products that you likely aren't going to find elsewhere.  Only 2 aisles and really 2 fridges, this place is small. The owner seems pretty nice. The beef jerky (biltong) is interesting. Uniquely African. Haven't had anything like it before."
The South African Store,"Lovely selection of South African groceries. A nice little piece of home, away from home. Love the owners, always friendly and helpful!"
The South African Store,"Love this little store that sells food and snacks you dont see often in supermarkets. This beef biltong is so good, its addictive! Im never eating those commercially sold beef jerky anymore!"
The South African Store,Very bad attitude of the stafftold me to leave since I was talking too much lol
The South African Store,Very interesting store - now I'm making an observation as a non South African native. But they have so many interesting products and brands which I assume is popular there. I also loved that many people came and went and made jokes with the lady behind the counter - seems like a real friendly atmosphere.
The South African Store,The best place to find Stoney Ginger Beer!
The South African Store,Absolutely love how close they are to the city! They always have a good variety of the things i miss from back in SA!
The South African Store,"How amazing is this that you can get great quality South African products locally. They have sourced out the best stuff and have really friendly staff. As a non-South African, I was so impressed with the products here that I have had to come back regularly to keep trying new things."
The South African Store,"As a South African living in Canada, I appreciate this place. It's so good to get a taste of home once in a while. I visit this store a couple of times a month and love it."
The South African Store,"We traveled to SA a few years and got hooked to a few snacks and chocolates there. This place has limited options, but great to be able to find some of those items. Price is higher than what we paid in SA, but that's ok since we're not doing the long and expensive trip."
The South African Store,Good svc and Alex was pleasantly helpful
The South African Store,"Amazing service! The gentlemam who worked here was friendly and helpful! An all around good experience! Plus I got South African treats, and you can never go wrong there!"
The South African Store,Great store lots of South African goodies and groceries that are just unable to find anywhere else. Lots of parking and the staff is always helpful and pleasant.  Wish they had other meat options other than beef for their biltong. But over all great SA grocery.
The South African Store,Interesting things they carry and the biltong is awesome. They even have the Cadbury flake! Hope they can sustain as they are speciality and life is hard for everyone Covid.
The South African Store,"I was sent an expired product. I called to ask for a refund or to be sent a new product and the owner proceeded to yell at me on the phone, hung up on me and then disconnected his phone. I would not recommend this business at all! I was extremely calm and polite and I have no idea why the owner was so rude and defensive. I was honestly completely shocked that someone can run a business in this manner and get so aggressive over a $5 bottle of sauce!"
The South African Store,I put 5 stars becoz if you put a lower one google pushes the review . Anyways I ordered $136 worth of products from this store and I am missing an item which I called the store and the rude baboon that answered the phone told i was bothering them . Anyways the item was paid but is not on my receipt.  I am missing ina parmann bbq spice .Non africans should sell african food stuff . You are rude and I am disputing the whole charge with my credit card company
The South African Store,Pleasant place to shop.  Very helpful.
The South African Store,Walking into this shop I was reminded of the empty shelves I saw in Zimbabwe about a decade ago. No offence but these guys need to have a store that is fully stacked with products. Maybe they are under economic sanctions like the aforementioned country
The South African Store,Nice variety. Owner is a very nice guy.
The South African Store,"Being buying from them for years ever since Bermondsy days. Mainly buy Boerwors (the best), Apricot Jam, Mrs Balls Chutney, Roses Lime Marmalade and Lemon Creams."

The South African Store,Great selection of South African products direct from South Africa. As well as locally produced meats with South African flavorings.

The South African Store,"The two owners are amazing so pleasant...The snacks are fresh, all the sweets from SA...Easily spend 50 bucks there"
The South African Store,This is a African Market that's owned by a white man who's not African and or Caribbean and knows absolutely nothing about our culture or our foods. Do not support this fake African market ??. I asked for plantain and he had no idea what that is.
The South African Store,It's a very small shop with some good old south african stuff but not a great variety and it's quite expensive not sure a whole lot in there you cant do without

The South African Store,"this is legit South African stuff

it's more expensive than you'll be used to but I took a South African there last weekend for Biltong and he was super happy, regardless of the price"
The South African Store,"Very pricey. A small variety of South African treats, probably the most disappointing was the low quality biltong!"
The South African Store,Excellent boerewors and biltong. A nice selection of SA's classic brands.
The South African Store,Wonderful biltong.  Alex and Zoe I regard highly for their high integrity and selfless caring for others.
The South African Store,Pleasant little speciality store. But they illegally refuse to take credit cards below a certain amount - debit only for small purchases
The South African Store,"Always nice to grab a taste of home, with the pies, spices, sauces, biscuits and chocolates."
The South African Store,"Friendly people, good selection. Sadly they dont have any fresh baked goods like milktart or koeksisters"
The South African Store,Great selection of South African favourites. Good parking. Easy access.

Sinit African Restaurant & Bar (98th St. NW),"Awesome meal.  We stopped by last night after seeing the restaurant a few months ago and thinking we should eat there some day.  We are so glad we did.  We ordered Beef Tibs and Veggie Combo.  The meal comes with a fantastic flat bread made with teff flour.  The flavors were wonderful, and amount of food was plentiful.  The waitress was helpful and very pleasant.  We will be back for sure. Dont let the part of town and look of the building from the outside deter you, the meal is worth it."
Sinit African Restaurant & Bar (98th St. NW),I've ordered here via skip the dishes and love the food! I tend to order the veggie combo and kitfo. Thanks for delicious meals :)
Sinit African Restaurant & Bar (98th St. NW),It is nice place to chill and good customer service.
Sinit African Restaurant & Bar (98th St. NW),Nice place to be if you want a cozy place and want to refresh ur self with horn African music.
Fartun Cultural Cuisine,"Our first time experienced African cuisine. We had Jamaican food before but of course they not the same lol this one is our favourite! The restaurant served you banana with meal, how neat! The food portions are big and they are absolutely delicious! We definitely come back again!"
Fartun Cultural Cuisine,"I ordered the chicken steak, the food was decent, the portions are great, I ended up leaving some in my fridge."
Fartun Cultural Cuisine,The worst restaurant you could ever go to they made me wait one hour and half they dont know how to run a business theyre unorganized they forgot about my order and every second the would tell me 5 minutes dont go here go to the one across the street this restaurant has to be one of the worst restaurants Ive ever been to. If I could give them zero star I would
Fartun Cultural Cuisine,What a great place for delicious food  they will never let you down ! Wonderful sized portions enough for a family of 7 !
Fartun Cultural Cuisine,"The customer service at this place is extraordinary, great food, nice people, and great options to choose from. very hardworking boy in the front too who gives a lot to make best possible for his customers!"
Fartun Cultural Cuisine,The best somali restaurant in edmonton that offers delicious food and great atmosphere. Staff very. Check out.
Fartun Cultural Cuisine,"We were just here an hour ago. My husband ordered beef and rice, and I had the goat with jabaati. The meat was the softest we have ever had at any restaurant anywhere. The value for the price is mind-blowing. I would have paid double the price for my meal easily.
The young lady who took our order spoke English quite well, which was honestly somewhat unexpected. I can imagine that most of the regular clientele is not Anglophone, so the effort on her part was greatly appreciated by both of us.
What this place lacks in atmosphere(it is the definition of a hole in the wall, imo) is more than made up for by the food, but their dinnerware and presentation is also lovely. We will be back, probably with friends. These ladies really deserve more business!"
Fartun Cultural Cuisine,The samosas and the BBQ chicken were both excellent!   Ordered on Skip.   It didn't take very long.
Fartun Cultural Cuisine,"Great food, great customer service. Definitely will come back for more."
Fartun Cultural Cuisine,2 vegetarian foodies ate here. Accidentally stumbled upon the place. It is unpretentious and homey. From the minute we opened the door we felt relaxed and welcomed. The before meal soup was amazing. We had 2 different veg plates that we shared. One plate had some sort of thick bread/pancake with it. We had mss as NGOs juice and a banana each for dessert. We were surprised by the affordable price. The cook is VERY talented. Im going back with another friend tomorrow for lunch.
Fartun Cultural Cuisine,"You have to try thier bbq chicken and lamb shanks, still so tender, huuge portions."
Fartun Cultural Cuisine,"Delicious and intriguing flavors with just the right hint of spice to wow your taste buds. Be sure to try unusual foods like goat meat and rice with cardomom spice.  And they showed us to eat pieces of banana with the meal, how cool!   We had leftovers that friends tried and they also couldn't get enough!"
Fartun Cultural Cuisine,"Very welcoming place with comfortable seating areas and delicious food. I had a mango juice, the hearty spinach soup with a main order of chicken, rice and salad."
Fartun Cultural Cuisine,The restaurant is top 10 In Edmonton. Fartuun restaurant I really like it and  I enjoyed the food. I order rice and king fish??.  It is so delicious ??.  The management are really good. And the chefs are very good cookers. It's comfortable. Also the customers are friendly they are very nice. Try it. And Anyone come to this restaurant please don't forget to give 5 start and comment. Because they deserve.
Fartun Cultural Cuisine,"Went here tonight and it was AMAZING! The BBQ chicken was fall of the bone tender and the rice was to die for! The salad that came was ok but obviously a bagged salad. Totally unnecessary in my opinion! This food shines ethnically and doesn't need to be ""westernized"" with a salad to make it big in the food industry in Edmonton. Keep up the good hosting too. Their service and the food they serve is unlike what most restaurants offer. I will definitely be back to try something new once again."
Fartun Cultural Cuisine,"We were just here an hour ago. My brother ordered beef and rice, and I had the goat with jabaati. The meat was the softest we have ever had at any restaurant anywhere. The value for the price is mind-blowing. I would have paid double the price for my meal easily. Service was great too."
Fartun Cultural Cuisine,Their food is sooo good! Mahsaallah to that ??
Fartun Cultural Cuisine,"I'm not sure if there is new management or owners, but this place has dropped the quality of both food and service considerably. The last five times I've gone in have been horrible, and I won't be returning. Don't expect items on the menu to be available, don't expect the staff to care enough to recommend substitutes, don't expect to be able to pay cash, and the samosas are cold anyway, go next door.

ORIGINAL 5-STAR REVIEW:
I have a dance studio across the street and whenever clients ask if there is a place to eat nearby I always recommend this place. Appearances are deceiving because this is a hidden gem of 118. The food is both delicious and reasonably priced. You are sure to have a pleasant surprise when stopping by!"
Fartun Cultural Cuisine,"First time having Somali cuisine, was recommended by family to visit. Went for Iftar and ordered the chicken suqaar and goat with rice. The beef stew/soup before the meal stole the show! Tender and packed with flavour. The Iftar plate was good with various fried items and a small portion of the chicken suqaar. The rice were aromatic and the goat was cooked well.
Will definitely be recommending this place to firends!"
Fartun Cultural Cuisine,"Outstanding quality. Unbeatable flavors. Recommend the spiced rice, grilled chicken, with spinach soup, lettuce on the side."
Fartun Cultural Cuisine,By far the worse restaurant in the city. Dont eat here. Do not order from here using any delivery services cause its nothing but a headache. They never read instructions they always mess up some way. If I could give this restaurant even a lower rating I would. Horrible experience. ????????????????????????????????????????
Fartun Cultural Cuisine,The samosas are the best that I've ever come across. The spicy sauce they give you with it is phenomenal. While waiting they will give a soup that just makes you want more. The review is late but I would recommend here for samosas ???? 10/10
Fartun Cultural Cuisine,Came to try some food one evening when the restaurant we wanted to go to was closed. We ordered the chicken steak and goat. We were pleasantly surprised by the amount of flavour each dish had. We came back on another day and tried the soup as well. Soooo good! Highly recommend stopping by.
Fartun Cultural Cuisine,"Amazing staff and food. The new management has extremely improved Im so happy with the changes and new look. The food, the quality, and cleanliness is definitely the best in the area.  The chefs and employees are great. I definitely recommend coming here anytime."

Fartun Cultural Cuisine,I came with my family here and enjoyed our lunch. Their food was decent and delicious ??
Fartun Cultural Cuisine,One of my favourites in the neighbourhood! This family owned and operated business is charming and friendly. The food is amazing! Best are the beef sambusa and chicken KK.

Fartun Cultural Cuisine,Please go for the exquisite dishes from another culture. As you will regret not trying it. Prices are average of the city's fare.

Lalibela African Restaurant,"We had an amazing dinner here! Everything was full of flavour and delicious. We had the mix platter which was a great way to try many different tastes. There was also plenty of injera bread to go with the dishes. The coffee and tea that we finished our meal with was fantastic! Would highly recommend this spot, especially if you havent tried Ethiopian cuisine before!"
Lalibela African Restaurant,We wanted to go somewhere different. So we just picked a random restaurant nearby. What an absolute charming place. Beautiful inside really friendly staff. The food was huge portions and absolutely delicious ??
Lalibela African Restaurant,"Treated myself to lunch here and was not disappointed. Clean atmosphere, good food, and great service. The lady even served the shiro wot onto my injeera. Recommended!"
Lalibela African Restaurant,"We were just stopping over in Edmonton as part of a three week trip to Canada and stumbled across this place - I am so glad we did!

The food is simply fantastic and way more filling than it looks! We are vegetarian so ordered the vegan platter. This place is conclusive proof that vegan food doesn't have to be boring - so many flavours and textures - delicious.

If you're ever in Edmonton, look up Lalibela. Absolute no brainer. You won't be disappointed.

Much love from Scotland!"
Lalibela African Restaurant,"My first time coming to this restaurant and was greeted by a friendly server who sat us down and served us with fresh traditional Ethiopian coffee with popcorn on the side and an amazing aroma. We ordered a platter which included a variety of sauces, meat/poultry, and vegetables. I would recommend getting this if it is your first time trying Ethiopian food as you can try multiple different dishes and experience all the different flavours. A personal favourite of mine was the Shiro. The service was amazing and will definitely be one of my go-to spots when Im craving a beautiful traditional feast. The restaurant itself was very clean and reminded me a lot of my home back in Ethiopia."
Lalibela African Restaurant,"This place was fantastic!! Under new ownership, with a wonderful chef who moved to Canada 6 years ago and is a single mom. This restaurant actually catered the Ethiopian tent at heritage days this year. The server was incredibly friendly and gracious. We had a platter of different curries with injeri bread, as well as a side plate of meat. We were totally stuffed, and everything was so delicious. Will absolutely come back the next time I am craving curries and injeri bread."
Lalibela African Restaurant,"Sooo crazy delicious. I'd love to eat here every day!!!
Get a plate with a bit of everything, vegetarian or meat options."
Lalibela African Restaurant,Got the vegan platter to go. We ordered ahead and she packaged it when we arrived so it would be fresh as possible. Chatted the few minutes while we waited. So friendly and wow was the food good. Highly recommended. I'm looking forward to going back for a meal in person.
Lalibela African Restaurant,Amazing!!! Best Ethiopian food we've had to date. Service was great.
Lalibela African Restaurant,"Shared the Mixed platter and Lalibelas Special Kitfo between three people, it was plenty of food. Was a great mix of various meats, veggies and sauces which allowed us to try everything. The spicy beef was amazing.  Their Injera is the best Ive ever had, theyve perfected this delicious vessel in taste and texture. You can tell they care about what theyre doing. Will definitely be back!"
Lalibela African Restaurant,"Pleasant service with tasty and flavorful food!!! I tried Afagn (???) - it was amazing. If you are in the greater Edmonton area and wants to try Ethiopian/Eritrean food, this is a great place!!!"
Lalibela African Restaurant,"I recently had the pleasure of dining at Lalibela, an Ethiopian restaurant, and I must say it was a delightful experience. The food was absolutely delicious, offering authentic flavors that truly transported me to Ethiopia. The kategna and Kornis dishes we ordered were particularly amazing.

The customer service was top-notch, with attentive staff who made me feel welcomed and ensured my dining experience was enjoyable.

I highly recommend Lalibela for its excellent food, friendly service, and inviting atmosphere."
Lalibela African Restaurant,"It was my first time trying Ethiopian food, and it was absolutely delicious! I had the veggie platter, and I cannot recommend it enough! The server was amazing as well! She was very helpful in explaining the dish, as well as some recommendations on other dishes to try next time! There will be a next time!!"
Lalibela African Restaurant,"Was craving Ethiopian food and this hit the spot! Food was super yummy, nice size portions (my husband and I couldn't finish this and we really tried cause it was so good) and good prices. Highly recommend!"
Lalibela African Restaurant,My wife and I are big fans of Ethiopian food and we were not disappointed. Excellent food and great service!
Lalibela African Restaurant,"This is the best spot to try Ethiopian food if you've never done so; I don't think you'll want to go anywhere else.

The cuisine is extremely flavorful, savoury, and amazing! We have always had friendly service to go with the excellent meal. You will undoubtedly be satisfied and even have leftovers for later thanks to the excellent prices. Excellent choices are available for vegetarians and vegans as well. You will adore Lalibela African Restaurant if you enjoy Ethiopian cuisine!"
Lalibela African Restaurant,The food here is delicious! We ate in and had the beef tibs and vegan platter and both were incredible - perfectly spiced and had tons of flavour. I'd definitely return to try more items.
Lalibela African Restaurant,"Wonderful. This place is an absolute gem. The food is great and the staff are delightful. If youve never had Ethiopian before this place will be a great introduction, and if you have had it before: great! Youll be in for a treat."
Lalibela African Restaurant,"Finally a great place for Ethiopian food again! Vegan platter was great, as was the Key wot. Fair bit of injera with each dish too.
If you loved Langano Skies, you'll love this place too!
Just wish there was an option for delivery, but when I went to pick up the food, the atmosphere was very cultural and nice so maybe dine in would be better."
Lalibela African Restaurant,"Excellent food. Be sure to set aside a bit of time because everything is made fresh and from scratch - this isn't fast food! But man, is it ever worth the wait! Will be back for sure!"
Lalibela African Restaurant,"This amazing this treat in Edmonton is such a delight. Women owned by a mother and daughter the food is comforting and full of flavor. Tons or options for vegan, vegetarians and meat-eaters alike. I couldnt recommend this spot more!"

Lalibela African Restaurant,"Her food is so yummy, never eat as good as this at a restaurant level . I tried her chacha tibes, Dulet kitfo, shiro, egg, and kornis . the best thing is , all her foods are made fresh ."
Lalibela African Restaurant,We had a great experiencie at Lalibela. It was our first time trying african food and Hannah explained everything to us with patience and a smile! Her recommendation was the best because we got to try different flavours in one plate. The food was excellent. Thank you so much Hannah fof the great service! We'll come back for sure.
Lalibela African Restaurant,"A 'must try' restaurant on 82 Ave. Wonderful, friendly service. A huge variety of flavors and spices with vegetarian and vegan choices plus all the meat a carnivore desires.

Zuhur Restaurant,"super comforting and friendly! the food is delicious and feels homemade & good quality.

there is a flavorful complimentary soup! we got Lamb Shank and Chicken Shawarma. each was $17.50 and pretty big portions.

the hostess was very friendly and welcoming. i would recommend this place to anyone and would go again to try their other items on the menu :)))"
Zuhur Restaurant,"The customer service is beyond great. They truly wanted me to feel welcome. I really enjoyed the complimentary soup, the cook said it was simple but that flavor is special. I enjoyed my goat and pasta as well. I would definitely recommend this place."
Zuhur Restaurant,"Zuhur, located on 107th with excellent parking and serving East African cuisine in a relaxed atmosphere. Friendly staff and value for money..Enjoyed the Mango smoothie and Vimto!"
Zuhur Restaurant,"I came here for dinner recently. The server was very friendly and let me know what they dont have in stock right from the start. He also explained the different types of food in great detail. In terms of food, I had their daily soup, the lamb shank with KK instead of rice/pasta (Xanid), mango juice, and samosa. The soup and juice being complimentary items is similar to other African restaurants that I have been to, but its still a nice surprise. All the food tasted really good. The soup had a lot of spice and flavour and I had multiple bowls. The juice and samosa were quite nice as well. The lamb shank with KK is definitely worth trying: It had nice cuts of tender and flavourful lamb, the KK was good on its own, and they complimented each other together."
Zuhur Restaurant,"We were actually looking for a nearby market and stumbled into the restaurant instead. My girlfriend and I were hungry from shopping, and decide to try the food.

We had a dish called Suqaar. It was excellent. The food was good and seemed to use fresh ingredients. The service was very friendly.

The decor was very simple, but tasteful. If you're looking for authentic African family cooking, this is the place."
Zuhur Restaurant,"I recently visited Zuhur Restaurant and had an amazing dining experience! They offer Somali cuisine in a casual, 'Mom's Kitchen' kind of atmosphere. Cutlery is optional here. If you've enjoyed casual African food before though, you won't be surprised by that. If you're put-off by this kind of casual experience you'll be missing an amazing meal but, at least you'll be leaving seats open for the rest of us.

I had the lamb and rice, and I have to say, it was one of the best meals I've had in a long time. The flavours were well balanced and the portion size was generous. Service was quick and plenty of Mango juice and tea were on hand too, of course.

African food is best served spicy but Zuhur caters to sensitive taste buds too. For those who prefer milder dishes, they can feed you as well. If you like spice as much as I do though, grab an extra shot of hot sauce, that stuff is awesome

I can cheerfully recommend Zuhur Restaurant to anyone looking for a delicious and satisfying meal. If you're a fan of African - Somali cuisine and, you appreciate home cooking served in the casual way that home style food is best enjoyed, this is a great place to go. The staff here was casual and friendly and everyone can enjoy the food regardless of their spice tolerance. Trust me, you won't be disappointed!"
Zuhur Restaurant,"The soup was so full of flavour and absolutely delicious, I had both the sweet chilli chicken and the KK and both were also so bomb ??"
Zuhur Restaurant,Customer service was great! The server was very friendly. I love the whole atmosphere of the restaurant. Food was very delicious! so worth the price!!
Zuhur Restaurant,Great family business the food was amazing especially the soup ?? and dont get me started with the meat it was really soft and tasty??
Zuhur Restaurant,"Lovely atmosphere, service and food were fantastic. The guy manning the front was super polite; another patron was (assumedly drunk) being quite insulting and causing a disturbance, but the kid handled it AMAZINGLY well and stayed calm and polite the entire time. 10/10 would absolutely recommend."
Zuhur Restaurant,"Dodgy goat! This is the first time I've gotten meat and have had to go home and cook it some more myself!!!! The lady who owns it is really sweet though,  and very customer service oriented, so I will consider this a once-off and try this place again..."
Zuhur Restaurant,"Absolutely amazing. I'm new to the African food scene in the city and I'm worried I won't try any more places and keep coming back here!!

The chicken wrap was incredible, definitely worth walking a couple blocks from Macewan... the hot soup will make it even more rewarding on a cold winter day."
Zuhur Restaurant,I got my order delivered to me and it tasted horrible. The serving was really really small and not enough for one person. I got the lamb liver by the way and it tasted like eggs.
Zuhur Restaurant,The best delicious Somali food In Edmonton. I really like it .
Zuhur Restaurant,Randomly stumbled upon this place and Im glad we did.  Great Somali food and good portions at a reasonable price.  Lee was very friendly and took the time to have a chat with us before we left.  We will be back again!
Zuhur Restaurant,"We ordered the lamb shank and the sweet chicken, both were super delicious! The portions were very generous, comes with salad, and pasta or rice or both. They gave us a free soup as well!

The service is also amazing. It was our first time to the restaurant, and the owner gave us a very personal introduction to all the dishes and was so fun and friendly.

I would definitely come back again and recommend it to everyone!"
Zuhur Restaurant,"Food was absolutely amazing. One of the best hidden gems of downtown. Getting food from here was like grandmas Sunday meal ( you know love and pride went into the food). I ordered the lamb shank, the meat fell off the bone and was just like butter."
Zuhur Restaurant,"Best samosas Ive ever had in my entire life! Plus the goat meal was so delicious and the soup had all the right flavours! Service was spectacular and everyone there was so friendly and accommodating! PS: youve got to try the pepper sauce, it wasnt too hot, it was just right! 10/10 recommend for a filling, home style meal ??"
Zuhur Restaurant,"This place makes excellent lamb shanks and goat meat. A dish generally includes one soup, salad a large portion of rice and meat.
The soup is not good, and the salads are alright, I wouldn't order them if I had to pay separately for these two items.
This place was a value proposition for the rice and goat meat at $13 a year before, now costs $17 plus charges if you use a debit card. Given its location, the small portions of goat meat, this is not a value proposition anymore, one feels like we are paying 10$ for the large portion of rice.
They have simply priced themselves out. I have tried their chicken and other dishes, none are outstanding to order twice."
Zuhur Restaurant,"Came here wanting something different and was not disappointed. We were greeted by a very friendly worker, and food was served quickly as we had our complimentary soup. Highly recommend the lamb platter. The service was amazing and the food was even better. Definitely recommend."
Zuhur Restaurant,"This is our favorite family restaurant. Incredible food at affordable prices and our go to dining experience when we're in the city. Staff are also the absolute friendliest. The soup is also incredible and I highly recommend the lamb, goat and sweet chicken. ??"
Zuhur Restaurant,The lamb shank was awesome! Just the right amount of flavour and spice. Loved the soup as well. The young man who served me was very friendly and welcoming. Will be back to try the other dishes.
Zuhur Restaurant,"amazing service, great food, definitely coming back!"
Zuhur Restaurant,Must try amazing wraps. Sweet chicken wrap soooo good. Very filling and excellent price.
Zuhur Restaurant,"Amazing food, great staff very friendly and kind, 10/10"
Zuhur Restaurant,"Amazing customer service, and the food was SO flavorful. It was my first time at Zuhur since - friend recommended them, and they did not disappoint. The portions were big and they had complimentary soup that was delicious. Definitely going back"
Zuhur Restaurant,"Very great tasting Somalian Sugar prepared food.  Large portions and very affordable.  Ended up taking leftovers home which is awesome.  The appetizer soup was nice and spicy.  Yum. Very friendly staff. Recommend you try it out.  Different beef, chicken and goat dishes.  Cant believe how inexpensive our bill was. And they dont want any tips.   Definitely would go back."
Zuhur Restaurant,"Hands down best lamb shank in town with rice. Service is outstanding here and quick. Sweet chicken is fire. An array of just delicious meals. The appetizer soup is tasty and spicy, ideal for any weather. You can tell every plate is crafted with passion and pride. I love it."
Zuhur Restaurant,"I used to like their goat meat and rice.
Prices have jumped from $13 to $19 for the same dish within a year or so. I find it too pricey for the food.
Given the location and minimal investment in the restaurant, the pricing is now a deterrent unfortunately. Too bad.
Staff and owners are great."
Zuhur Restaurant,"Ive given this restaurant to many chances first time there and my daughter and I both got food poisoning from their food. I decided to give them another chance to support my community, but what a disappointment. These guys continue to show how they are the biggest liars, who lie to their own Somali community. I ordered off skip and had left a note for the food to be well done, and that the order was sloppy, old and stale. The owner ends up calling me and asks me what I didnt like about the food. I literally just wrote it down in the notes, but your going to call me back with attitude and question me about my note I had left. Who intimidates their customers like this, so you do not want feedback? They then had the audacity to say they delivered my food when they did not. I then contacted skip to tell them about my missing delivery, the driver continued to lie and say he delivered right to my hands. This is a complete lie and a complete waste of my time and money. They have the worst food ever. If your looking for good Somali food, I would look else where. They will steal your money and not deliver food. They are rude, restaurant is dirty, food is old. If you want food poisoning eat from here."
Zuhur Restaurant,"Food was amazing! I had the rice and chicken and my friend had the rice and goat, both were great. The lady is super sweet and attentive. I usually go to other restaurants for Somali food however this is definitely my new go to spot!"
Zuhur Restaurant,one of the best somali restaurant
Zuhur Restaurant,"Very warm and welcoming environment. They have the best soup that I have ever gotten at a Somali restaurant. My favourite dish is the sweet chicken with the rice. Great portion size, and the food is always fresh. Zuhur never disappoints."
Zuhur Restaurant,"Very tasty food, best place for lamb meat!"
Zuhur Restaurant,My favorite dish is the sweet chicken and I make all my friends partake in my obsession. The customer services is always top notch and the portions are extremely generous. Highly recommend.
Zuhur Restaurant,I have had the Goat and Rice a few times mostly delivery it's absolutely delicious. I went into the restaurant alone today and such a great welcoming friendly staff where everyone is treated like family. I'm non African and was warm heartily welcomed.

Zuhur Restaurant,Very friendly and foods very very good
Zuhur Restaurant,"The sweet chicken was ridiculously good, the portion size was very filling and the staff is super friendly. I was pleasantly surprised!"
Zuhur Restaurant,"The lady was really friendly..but there's a guy who was really rude feom the get go and doesn't know how to treat customers.my friend n I went in there to order food, so the lady welcomed us with a big smile n brought soup for us, as we r eating our soup she brought the menu, we later found out the main dish we came for wasn't on the menu because it sold out, so my friend says we will go else where to have that menu which they didnt have. As we stood up to leave we left knowing that we would not pay for the soup the lady served us because she had said from the beginning that it was complimentary. As we were leaving the guy rudely yelled at use for eating the soup and said since we didnt buy any food items we need to pay for soup. He was literally yelling at us from across the restaurant so my friend fought back and said the server said it was complimentary so we are not paying for it.. the main issue is not oayi g for the food, had we known it was complimentary fekm the start we will happily pay for it. But we had no idea. This was my first time going there but my friend is a regular customer who orders from them sk she recommended we go there to eat as planned. Due to the rude behavior and service received by that guy m eating this place due to bad ??service.. lady was really nice and welcoming but the guy ruined it for us. Wont be going there any more."

Fit4Less,"I workout here almost everyday and just choose times that are not too busy (these are mostly evenings), equipment are great, complete as well, i just need the stairmaster as well too lol"
Fit4Less,"The fitness club is not bad, but a huge minus is the staff who are never at the reception.  they constantly put a sign that they will return in 4 minutes, but in fact there is no one for 1.5 hours.  To use the massage chair you need to run, look for and beg employees.  What they get paid for I still don't understand!  other fit4les don't have this mess! and it's permanent"
Fit4Less,Nice gym. Not crowded in mornings. Cheaper than others in the same area. Gym equipment is in pretty good condition and lot of variety.
Fit4Less,"The Black Card Room just got expanded! 4 squat racks, a hip thrust machine (woohoo!) and an area that's actually breathable since it's no longer confined into one small room--instead, sharing one roof with the rest of the gym. Friendly staff is always a plus. ??"
Fit4Less,"1911 Finch Ave W. is typically clean. No major quams about this location outside of wishing that they would put on a movie, nature channel or something more interesting then cp24.  I (female) will note however, the staff are very rarely at reception as they tend to do tasks in pairs (if they are doing tasks that is).  I very seldom interact with the staff and cant even remember a time Ive even gotten a welcoming smile or greeting in my years of visiting this location.

Today I forgot my water bottle and as I exited the Women's washroom, no shocker,  both employees on duty were together heading towards the utility room. So I kindly interrupted one to advise that I had to go back for my water but as I just tapped my card I would need her to let me back in. She gave me a dismissive head nod (might have uttered  an okay) and I went about my way to my car. To no surprise, she wasnt at the desk to let me back in. I was standing there for a minute and a patron who was exiting tapped her card for me. Embarrassing. When I arrived inside, the same staff was casually pushing the garbage bin with her other coworker as if she had forgotten that I had literally just asked for her assistance.

A bit more attentiveness and smile from the staff would increase the ratings at this location."
Fit4Less,"Not too bad
Busy days are a pain and Monday evenings are the worst ??
Other than that, I have no major complaints.
I just wish that the black card room was actually interesting and had different equipment (I can't lift that heavy yet lol)"
Fit4Less,This gym is always busy and you're always waiting for machines. The bathroom's tend to be out of service occasionally. And for some reason a handful of the equipment is in need of repairs. The gym is very friendly and the staff are extremely nice.
Fit4Less,"Only worth it if price is all you care about - and even then its a stretch. Theres always a few machines broken, equipment missing, and worst of all, always crowded. Its not a large gym either. Theres better options than this location."
Fit4Less,"Good for a budget gym. Doesn't have all the different machines and stations, but enough to complete a workout. Fairly clean and maintain. It is under going some renovations. Looks like it'll expand the black membership only area."
Fit4Less,Every single machine is broken but the staff at this location is nice. Gym is cleaned on regular basis. Rajan suthar is the best employee.
Fit4Less,I started a membership here and cancelled it in jan but was still getting charged. I went into the gym and asked why am i still getting charged they said they got a reactivation notice. I never went in nor did i call in to reactivate it they checked my account and it was inactive since i cancelled it so why was it activated again without my consent? Apparently anyone can use your name and dob to reactivate your account without you knowing. No email was also sent out for reactivating so if you dont check your account you would be paying to them not knowingly for something you thought you cancelled Such scammers. Anyone cancelling there membership at this location better check your monthly statements because someone at this location will reactivate your account ??
Fit4Less,"Having extremly disappointing experience from empress walk location by finch station I was just about to give up on Fit4less and sign up with other gyms till I came to this location. The gym is relatively new and much much bigger than empress location, and best of all they have water fountain, something crucial thats missing from other locations. Front staff are professional and well-mannered. Gym does get quite packed around evening. But you can still. Manage to work out just fine."
Fit4Less,"The mens washroom at this location is absolutely diagusting, they have been out of soap for over the a week at this location! Some of the soap dispencers have been broken as well, And none of the emoyees seem to be bothered about it, just a dirty fit4less location."
Fit4Less,"Been going here for about 2 years. Firstly, the price is really good for the equipment. They have 3 bench presses, 6 smith machines, plenty of free benches for barbells, lots of cable machines. 2 Squat racks in the blackcard workout area. Also lots of cardio machines to use.

Gym gets busy after 4pm so be wary but even around then you can get a good workout.

Cleanliness is pretty good I always see staff going around cleaning things. I have no complaints about the staff mainly because I almost never interact with them, but they seem ok. The gym is always open 24hrs including holidays.

People in the gym are from most age groups (depending on the time of day). Mostly guys during peak hours (I'm a guy but if you're a girl this might matter).

When comparing this gym to the one on Lawrence it has more equipment, an actual water fountain, 24hrs, and your cell signal works."
Fit4Less,Just very pathetic! Tried calling them multiple times. And there is a loud beep sound that goes on after which no one answers the call. Seems like accidently one of the guy picked up the call and he kept me on hold and disappeared!
Fit4Less,"Great!! Awesome! Cheap! 24/7, Wide facilities,lots of equipment,friendly employee, always clean and always cleaning and its inside the mall so whatever u nid shopping,groceries,food etc its all in one place"
Fit4Less,"Good staff when they are there. Generally clean. Get packed during peak hours; recommend coming at off-peak if you can. Biggest downfall is that this location is a theif's paradise. Don't leave items unlocked or at the front - it WILL get stolen and staff will ""check the cameras"" but in truth they don't care. You've been warned."
Fit4Less,"I came for a work out yesterday  April4'2023 at 5:15pm and tried to ask for some assistance, and two ladies in the office informed me that they are not working, yet they were in their uniforms. They responded with attitude and were not polite. Please do better FIT 4 Less."
Fit4Less,"A place for fitness
It's got a lot of equipments and a great facility"
Fit4Less,"I chose this location over the Planet Fitness across the street because it didn't require my my banking info for the annual membership.  It is a larger gym and a chain of Goodlife so it's Canadian.

Pros
Friendly staff
24 hrs
A friend can share your pass when you aren't there.
Black Card gives you
Free Hydro massage
Free Tanning
Free Massage chair
Access to other Fit4Life
Open house last Thurs of every month for friends and family.

Cons
Planet Fitness has same Black Card perks
No Wifi
No plugs for your phone
Free perks only available when staff is there (and hours aren't convenient for staff to be there) Would be better if you could use your pass to access massage machines"
Fit4Less,"This location is the best hands down. Its spacious, has massage chairs, tan room, clean washrooms, locker, changing rooms, showers open24/7. Doesn't smell like sweat, incredibly efficient staff ?? . Free parking. Has water fountain. Free wifi (finally). ??

On the downside - Lockers are tiny. Its HOT as hell inside, like the AC barely works. I see people  profusely sweating, I often stop working just because of the heat."
Fit4Less,"The staff is absolutely amazing!!! Everyone is so friendly and nice.
The new manager did an amazing job cleaning up the gym and handles all complaints in a respectful way.

I always feel welcomed with lots of smiles and laughs from the staff
If I could I would give them 6 stars!!
Great job!"
Fit4Less,"Good place to workout.

One staff doesnt have any common sense. He goes cleaning washrooms on a busy afternoon and takes forever to open for gym users."
Fit4Less,"Decent gym and decent space but overall not enough machines that specific and specialize enough. If you're a casual gym goer / bro looking for a cheap place, this is your domain.

If you're looking for personal training or an experience, this is not it as their lack of experience and staff don't really know what they're doing in terms of knowledge on themselves or even when they give advice. I've gone here for a couple of years and even during covid and the management isn't great, the staff was mediocre at best as they went to clean up but more times than not, the gym overall was a mess.

I've also had a poor experience when it came to a dude with roid rage as he threw a plate at me and management took a over a week to address and kick him out. This showed me how much they really care but then again, $5 biweekly for a membership is what you get right? Who cares about the members. Manager here didn't really help me out when it came down to billing as well when I was charged on multiple occasions even after cancelling. He said, he couldn't do anything for me and to bite the bullet."
Fit4Less,Liked the atmosphere but staff is not friendly or doesnt help while they are still there but dont help us out.
Fit4Less,This one star is only for the staff. They getting paid only for standing there and watching at people faces. Thats the reason I asked my friend to cancel the membership for fit 4 less
Fit4Less,Always too crowdy....dont go there...most of the time no staff at the desk.... cancelling my membership
Fit4Less,"Overcrowded, and the machines are never available to use. Every time I had to use leg extensions and it's always in maintenance mode.."
Fit4Less,"Great job to staff always keeping the place nice and tidy. Choice of music played is horrible. They've been keeping up with the broken machines very good.
If only there are more barbells and clips as deadlifters are hogging it all."
Fit4Less,"The new manager named ""Muna"" or ""Mona"" or ""Runa"" was extremely rude and impolite. The staff here were fine and greet people but not the manager. Totally opposite with the previous manager. She gets a lot of complaints about her attitude everyday but don't know why she still here."
Fit4Less,"This is the best Fit4Less location! Kelvin, Alexia, and Kianna are amazing staff. They go above and beyond for their customers. This gym is SO clean and spacious with a great variety of fitness equipment. I highly recommend checking it out, truly the best!"
Fit4Less,"Super clean, pretty spacious. Staff is pretty good for the most part. However, pleeeeeeease add a couple of free weight squat racks. Currently all the squat racks are this ""freedom rack"" where the bar is stuck to the machine and you can move it forward, but its a completely different feel compared to free weight."
Fit4Less,"I went to this gym for the first time and I misplaced my key card, I asked for a new one and I did expect a charge for it but not $22 3x my membership. So I decided to cancel and they told me I needed to give a 30 days notice and they would still continue to charge me even if I dont use it. Just so you know there will rob you of your own money"
Fit4Less,Such a poor management. I want to share one horrible incident that happened with me and my friend The manager at the branch Mrunan I guess her name is. She was so freaking rude and aggressive on me and my friend just for the reason that one of us forgets our access card at the home and did entered the gym only on the one card that we were having with us. There was no one at the front desk to help people entering at that time. When we entered she came out of the room and literally yelled at us and said us that she is denying our entry as we entered on one card. We mentioned her that we are very sorry about that but we are active member please check in your records. She did not listened to that and told us that she will cancel our membership and call the security to get us off the premises. It was getting so embracing for us as we never experienced something like that before in our lives. We also told her that we are new members dont know the policies well and someone was not there at the front desk at that time. But rather than listening to her she called the security and threatened us regarding calling the cops for such a small thing.
Fit4Less,"Horrible manager. Signed up online and worked out there a couple times until I saw the manager there. She has a very bad attitude, never greet anyone, did nothing but stand at the front desk and gave gym members hard time. Worst customer service in the gym industry. Cancelled my membership. AVOID AT ALL COST. FIRE THE MANAGER"
Fit4Less,A spacious gym with a lot of equipment. Nice if you're a beginner trying to work out for the first time or just want to workout once in awhile. The employees are friendly and helpful for the most part.
Fit4Less,Their washroom water taps are very cold which is bad for winter season. They need to fix this issue or at least speak to the landlord to get their water system fixed
Fit4Less,"This is the worst gym ever the employees that works here are all immature and unprofessional the only care about their friends if youre friends with them you will get the best  welcome when you enter they have no respect for other members furthermore  they dont speak proper English I dont know why the were employed at front desk when their lack of professionalism, to the owner do something or else you will gradually lose members treat all your members equal"
Fit4Less,"The best gym in North York, always super clean, coordinated  and enough equipment for everyone, staff are great and always available to assist.. However, Your music playlist was probably designed for dinner dates and am also curious why I haven't heard African music play ??"
Fit4Less,"Went to the gym with a friend to workout and a worker was extremely rude and ignorant. She even threatened to ban our membership. What kind of gym threatens people who are just trying to work and focus on their well being?? It was extremely rude of her and she has no manners whatsoever. I hope she learns the decency of being a human and learns to be considerate of others feelings - especially if theyre shy to workout in front of others.

I have never experienced such rude customer service or even just the rude manners of a worker - she made it extremely hard to continue working out knowing the negativity she impacted on myself and my friend. Hope one day she learns kindness and generosity of the heart."
Fit4Less,Basic basic. Has showers and good equipment
Fit4Less,"Still one of my favorite places to be, was there on the weekend, Jane and Finch location...gym is life??????"
Fit4Less,"Prices are quite reasonable.  The environment is cleaning, huge, many different equipments, staff is helpful.  Location is safe and convenient. Newcomers have to sign up with credit cards"
Fit4Less,There staffs are  ok! But all three Shower rooms don't  have hot water at all!
Fit4Less,"This one is the 5th I tried and it was a nice experience, its huge , spacious, the location is not bad . People are cool and Yh not so many girls but its fine and kinda clean ."
Fit4Less,Too crowded anytime you go there  some of the machines are broken. Time to switch
Fit4Less,"I can't unsubscribe online, so they tell me I have to go straight to the gym, after my work and only in time gap when staff working, why can't I just cancel it online? Terrible"
Fit4Less,Nice & Clean large Facility with multiple equipment.
Fit4Less,Just because you work out that does not make you a good staff! I guess fit4less dont have any criteria while hiring staff in this location. The rest is ok for this location. Dont Believe fake good comments with mentioning people name! Where is Quality control and inspection for this corp?!
Fit4Less,I only gave one star because I did not have a choice of 0. The staff is spiteful and ignorant. They care less about the members and basically Allow their friends to use the gym. While members pay. I called and canceled my membership after one day use. I canceled because of my observation and my needs for a gym was not met.  Previously I had a GoodLife membership but due to Covid the pool was closed so I thought ok I will use fitforless until Covid goes away. Fitforless says I can call and cancel. So I did. To this day April first my account was charged again. Today I am going to my bank to settle this. This place is a mess and people should really find a better gym. The staff there are horrible!!!!! Bad customer service and friends being allowed in without paying as everyone does is so wrong. I even overheard a young man asking to be let in without his proof of vaccination. When told no he told the service rep that his other colleague allows him to use the gym. Sighhhhhh!!!!! Bad experience
Fit4Less,"Good place to workout, equipment is always clean and functional, staff are helpful when you need them. Membership prices are cheap if you are looking to save money too!"
Fit4Less,"This location is fantastic. The staff are amazing. The equipment is maintained in excellent condition and the facility is always spotless. Although I carry the black card membership, this is my location. Only if I'm away do I ever use another location, and it's always great to come home to my location. Keep up the great work you amazing teams ??"
Fit4Less,"I was new to Canada and was looking for a gym that was near to me and affordable. I didn't hesitate signing up for a year and I haven't been disappointed yet. What impresses me more is that the employees go beyond the normal cleaning and clean every crack on the machines daily. The staff are very friendly and it's 24 hours, even when no staff is available. I would highly recommend to anyone who's in the North York area to check this out at the Finch Mall"
Fit4Less,Nice place but no proper squat rack
Fit4Less,"Fire the manager, she doesnt have the etiquettes of how to deal with customers. Being in customer service their duty is to help their members rather than just bashing at them and threatening them to call the cops for no reason. Some action must be taken on this."
Fit4Less,"Membership price is good for what you get. It seems like the gym is extremely full until 11pm, most of the machines will be used by someone else and you will have to wait. It has basically everything you need to work your entire body. There are no free weight squat racks as they are all smith machines which is disappointing. There is a water fountain which is a rare sight in Fit4Less gyms. Some of the machines are out of order and it takes a long time for them to be repaired. Budget friendly gym in the North York area."
Fit4Less,Went on a Saturday to get a tour of the gym. No staff to be found.
Fit4Less,Great people Great place Great Environment I love this place
Fit4Less,"Would recommend to get a planet fitness membership across the street at least they have good customer representatives.

CONSIDER THIS AS ZERO STAR

staff here is very rude, Ignorant

FIRE THE MANAGER."
Fit4Less,Bad service. Manager she does not respect customers and don't scared peoples to cancel the membership. I canceled and moved to planet fitness.
Fit4Less,So glad that black card workout area was expanded
Fit4Less,Massive with tons of equipment. I'm sure even if I went during peak hours I wouldn't have to wait for anything because that's how much equipment there is. Biggest one I've been too and clean all around. I've even seen employs walking around cleaning the machines. Impressed and completely worth the membership.
Fit4Less,"New I love the smell of new. This location is only 2 wks old. This definitely is the best fit4less location I've come across so far. The size of the gym is massive, many pieces of equipment so you're never waiting.I was pleased to see staff mopping up the facility And cleaning. They are one of the more advanced locations with virtual workouts , showers, tanning beds and many massage chairs. Because I have to kill time for 1.5hrs this location works perfect for me. It's new so not a lot of clients yet but I  predict many members very soon. Hopefully in the next 6 months the gym is still clean and all machines in working order"
Fit4Less,"Why can't you guys add a trap bar, to the gyms in northyork? Not everyone likes the straight bar to do deadlift and I one of those people."
Fit4Less,FIRE THE MANAGER AS SHE ALWAYS THREATEN THE CUSTOMERS FOR CANCELLING THE MEMBERSHIP AND CALLING THE COPS WITHOUY ANY SENSE. WOULD RECOMMEND THE GYM ACROSS THE STREET AS ATLEAST THEY ARE MORE WELCOMING AND CUSTOMER ORIENTED.
Fit4Less,"Pros:  Very clean, great staff. Showers work well and there are lots of change rooms.
Cons:  Ventilation isn't good. (Air is thick and humid) Lots of equipment but not much variety. Meaning, lots of similar or same machines."
Fit4Less,"This is a good facility available to the residents of Jane and Finch vicinage.
A good number of people - ladies and gentlemen - take advantage of this fully equipped and hygienic health club which is open day and night (24/7.)
You can find numerous machines of your choice. Generally, you are not required to wait for any machine simply because there are many of them.
Fit 4 Less is owned and operated by Good Life Fitness, so the management is good, and the customer service is satisfactory.
If you believe in the unlimited benefits of physical exercises, like to exercise in a place where many people are exercising, want to be and remain fit, and do not want to pay hefty fees, Fit 4 less is worth a try."
Fit4Less,"Some of the most unfriendly people work at this locations, and they lie that they don't have anymore bags left for blackcard members..."
Fit4Less,To the manage of this branch: please fire the person who is in charge of a playlist. The music played is meant to put you to sleep and not get the iron pumpin'.
Fit4Less,"If I could, I would give 0 stars.
I have been trying to talk to someone from this facility all day. No automated messages, no pickups, no call backs, no single information! Someone or something picks up the call and all I hear is some buzzing noise which is really creepy. I understand things work different under COVID regulations, but come on there has to be some kind of information."
Fit4Less,"Great gym, very big and spacious. Lots of free weights. Friendly staff. 24/7 even on holidays. Good amount of change rooms and showers. Would highly recommend."
Fit4Less,Staff at this location acts too much at times same staff that sees you coming to the gym 6days a week will still ask ti see your vaccination proof like I understand you trying to follow you r job rules but still they act arrogant while asking for the vaccine proof
Fit4Less,"Love this gym. Missing a few machines that I love but also well equipped, big and clean. Friendly staff too !"
Fit4Less,"Always clean and tidy even during peak hours. The clientele is serious about working out which is great as there aren't any machine hoggers or people constantly on their phone taking pictures for instagram.

Minimal supervision though which limits usage of showers and service door if you want to bring in your bicycle."
Fit4Less,"This is my sanctuary.
Honestly the biggest gym and the only location to have a water fountain compared to other locations. The staff are pretty awesome, they will happily give you a bandage when you cut yourself. There's a multitude of equipment to use from. The highest dumbbells are 75lbs and the highest small barbells are 110lbs. Weekdays it gets hella packed during the evenings at around 5-7pm but if you have a partner, you can superset machines no problem. I haven't had an issue with deadlifting heavyweights so I'm going to assume that it's fine.
Just remember we are all here to be the strongest version of ourselves. If you need a spotter, ask the guy next to you, he'd be happy to help. Focus on form, breathe, stay consistent. Unleash that killer instinct."
Fit4Less,"Very too much spacious and great place for exercise. Manager and other staff is great.
Just one request - please change the timing to open before 8 am."
Fit4Less,"I subscribe and 3 days in a row I wasnt able to « book » an appointment at 3 of the nearest gym because they were all full. How can you makes people pay for this poor service and when I speak to someone the only answer I got is : there is nothing we can do its the covid mesure. Well, yes there is something you can do. REFUND MY MONEY. And I will train at home. But without surprise , the refund option on the website is inexistant. what a mediocre enterprise."
Fit4Less,The equipment is great and there's plenty of dumbbells and machines for a full body workout. Doesn't get too crowded on weekdays so you'll still have a chance to do everything you need.
Fit4Less,"It's right down the street from me so it has that going for it. Otherwise the staff is good, there's enough equipment to accomodate anyone, in sure this isn't the best location with all the bells and whistles but there is massage chairs, tanning, lots of free weights and racks"
Fit4Less,"It is extremely frustrated to cancel membership at Fit4less even we have given a 30 days notice. After Covid-19, it seems like they intentionally disregard the cancellation request to make money from their existing members. Where is the business integrity? Ricardo, the manager, has promised and verified the cancellation yet they still took the next payment without notice. Is it how they operate their gyms during the pandemic?"
Fit4Less,"Good place and friendly staff. The kembership rates are good aswell, very affordable. However you do need your second dose of the covid19 vaccine to enter."
Fit4Less,Most of the equipment are broken....poor maintenance of the equipment
Fit4Less,"EXCELLENT SERVICE!! AMAZING PERSON????
This Employee (Elkaneh) is really the definition of a gentleman as well as professional. This is the best customer service I have ever had the pleasure to meet. H was a totally professional in every way. Best of the best. Many thanks.
??????????????????????????????????"
Fit4Less,Good Gym.
Fit4Less,I was actually surprised to see that this was one of the cleaner bigger and nicer locations they actually have a water machine that you can use unlike some of the other locations La Cruz are also as free as matter fact I forgot my shoes on the Rock overnight went back and they were
Fit4Less,"Best gym ever , clean , organized the staff is super helpful, especially Kevin :) ??
The only thing it gets super busy after 5 pm, I think the management or the owner should do something about that , I know lots of people would love to join if The gym was a bit bigger !"
Fit4Less,Great fitness equipment and the staff are very welcoming.
Fit4Less,"Pros:
Has a water fountain
Very large gym compared to other locations
Amazing staff
Super clean environment
Plenty of equipments to use
Many change rooms, lockers and showers

Cons:
Can get crowded during peak hours around dumbbell area and cable cross over machines
Cable fly machine to adjust for rear deltoids are broken sometimes"
Fit4Less,"You arrive at the square and there are no signs to enter the gym, you have to be like a fool looking everywhere for the entrance or asking people where the gym entrance is"
Fit4Less,"Huge gym, has 3 bench press and 4 squat racks compared to the Steeles Fit4less, can finally get my workout done without having to wait. Better yet, has a water fountain!"
Fit4Less,Excellent gym. Has everything but a squat rack. Staff are courteous and very friendly. Rarely over crowded even at peak times.
Fit4Less,"Cheep gym with great staff. Everything  you need for a workout.

No pool or sauna... but its dirt cheep so who cares."
Fit4Less,"Good equipments, better staff, best value for money."
Fit4Less,Worst gym no Wi-Fi which is big drop and its all the way end of Jane and finch mall its not convenient at all.
Fit4Less,Great facility. Very clean. Staff are very friendly and helpful. I would definitely go there. Mornings are the best.
