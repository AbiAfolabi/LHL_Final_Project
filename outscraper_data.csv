Honestly so disappointed in this store.
I have been cheated more than twice and most times they claim its a mistake. They knowingly cheat you and add to the bills you have and when you find out, they claim its a mistake.
The first time this happened to me, i thought it was actually an error on their part but when it kept repeating itself, i knew they were aware of what they were doing.
please make sure to check your receipts properly when you buy things from this store and most importantly look at the price before you go to the counter so they don't add to it, as they are fond of doing this.

EDIT:

They now have a pos system which issues receipts and more transparent system, hence I have come back to edit review.",,,,,,,,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPbWFUdmVBEAE!2m1!1s0x0:0xb9441f4294334ce4!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIDOmaTveA%7CCgsIg6r2pAYQgPn4EA%7C?hl=en-US,4.0,1688048899.0,06/29/2023 14:28:19,10.0,-5096914507461866268,5.0,2.0,3.0,16.0,32.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

your statement does not represent the facts. The product was not expired at time of purchase; is not expired at this present time (August 1, 2022) and is good for another 4 weeks as evidenced by Best Before Date: end of August 2022 (of which you were made aware at the time of purchase). During your call to us, we endeavored with utmost courtesy to explain the best before date displayed as month and year (without a specific date) translates to end of the month, and not the begining.

I went to the location to purchase a new Andis T professional beard and hair trimmer.  Originally the location had 2 in stock when i went in to purchase the razor and i chose the first box on display.  After leaving with my purchase, I hadn't considered opening the box to check the product until i reached my next destination and thats when i realized the razor was used, rusted and broken.  I returned to the location right away to ask for an exchange as the product i purchased was damaged and clearly well used.  Instead of agreeing to an exchange, the employee refused and stated that i should have opened the box before leaving the store and that she actually believed i had taken the ""newly"" purchased razor and replaced it with my own used and broken razor... in that case, why would i have asked for an exchange.  When she refused to exchange the damaged product, i then asked for a refund which she then told me she was not authorized to give and that i would need to speak with the owner who was conveniently not at the location and could not be reached at that time.

This is an ongoing scam in Africa and after speaking with the owner the next day, she told me that she needed a week to investigate what may have happened.  These locations provide African food and products and ive seen these razors sitting on the shelf collecting dust, i chose to purchase the pruduct so i could support a black owned small business when i could have easily purchased the razor from Amazon.  I left the damaged and used razor with them and gave up on getting any money returned to me, i really just want others to be weary and aware that it may happen to them as well.",,,,,,,,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4bkpycElBEAE!2m1!1s0x0:0x3ba9d09dfcf8534!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgICxnJrpIA%7CCgsI2eD5ogYQsNWIfQ%7C?hl=en-US,1.0,1683910745.0,05/12/2023 16:59:05,0.0,None,9.0,2.0,7.0,33.0,70.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Honestly so disappointed in this store.
I have been cheated more than twice and most times they claim its a mistake. They knowingly cheat you and add to the bills you have and when you find out, they claim its a mistake.
The first time this happened to me, i thought it was actually an error on their part but when it kept repeating itself, i knew they were aware of what they were doing.
please make sure to check your receipts properly when you buy things from this store and most importantly look at the price before you go to the counter so they don't add to it, as they are fond of doing this.

EDIT:

They now have a pos system which issues receipts and more transparent system, hence I have come back to edit review.",,,,,,,,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPbWFUdmVBEAE!2m1!1s0x0:0xb9441f4294334ce4!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIDOmaTveA%7CCgsIg6r2pAYQgPn4EA%7C?hl=en-US,4.0,1688048899.0,06/29/2023 14:28:19,10.0,-5096914507461866268,5.0,2.0,3.0,16.0,32.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is a store I have seen expired palm oils on the shelf severally but the store owner had the audacity to preach to me about food handling. I want to point out the double standard and hypocrisy.

Those high star reviews look fake
And the 1 star reviews are true
I don’t know if staff hate their jobs or not
But they better watch themselves
Because out in reality here
They wouldn’t last a second treating people the way they do
These staff are criminals, they lie about customers, they hate their jobs, they’re racist, homophobic, and in some cases, misogynistic.

I actually witnessed a staff assault a customer with a shopping cart, and then yell racist slurs at this customer until they left, clearly injured.

This store is disgusting. Zero out of 5 stars. Johann the manager: do your job and train staff properly.

I was so appalled at the crime I witnessed staffed perpetrate that I contacted the corporate offices to let them know these staff have attacked customers just for shopping at their store.

A ticket costs $22.

I think about 45 minutes is all you need on the observation deck. They have a water fountain on the observation deck too.

The area has a brief video and some facts shown around the room.

It is also the place where you can catch a bus to and from the airport which makes a day trip super convenient.

It was $21 per person since we bought tickets at the tower. Online tickets were listed at $19, but the person at the desk told us that it's more expensive to buy online for groups of less than 3, and was about the same price for groups of 3 since there were various fees involved with buying online. The tower was quite nice, though tickets only get you access to the observation deck and a theatre were they play a video about the history of Calgary and the tower, which is informative. But I don't think that it was quite worth the price. You get a view of the entire city, and there are Information boards telling you the names of all the buildings and landmarks. The view isn't quite 'stunning' though and there are buildings that have been built that are taller than the tower. You can also tell that the tower is getting up there in age. Overall it was a nice enough experience, I definitely wouldn't say it's a must-see attraction if you're in Calgary, but it's good if you want to see the city and are willing to pay a bit more than you probably should.",https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP5vrwhBI-BftuygSXoPONCJy3qj9DBsas-BlJM,"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP5vrwhBI-BftuygSXoPONCJy3qj9DBsas-BlJM, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPr_b7QjqPdj6PX54zjqVQx8DDrbnAtC9umNjUX, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPIB8TFPuuTTVZSpgqTwTv25dbK_WtMUskR-fkV, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOzdA7gg9RYO4wOLTlbVv7W4ZLGJsD88gytm5dz, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOEQbQrXTmqAvr3qS9qFubDNrQg9UR6nfXNMTDp, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOotZD7S-6V3XjW6Lv7edCx6-4l_lkRF5VEvPuZ, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOGtdczbNeMj3insM9-ZNdIWYX1hUbbqht-OmKy, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPA8mvaNaOHN6G6jMu0TgG54jbFCOtAs6JlD957, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN9sxEmnGJ-tU0-6YM9zVWBA2c5UK4RBiObSb3K, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNYNB8yy1u6ZMD-n_XQlymHx7VxGp3SpriKihXD, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOAqny2OO2aBlftPnOLWASJ-wwMJXNDDF0AWYGa, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN8oKdHTr50vrjix1NBhkN2xCKUm5SzS8kWGMsO, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMC6JclXcWlf3Rq5Y0P1-KkhyxBcOTeiZUVEF9v, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNRtBGthfFHQcETqQjzzjrIIiQpaOq9txAnuV6v, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN4ztN-0CEQswdpVZKKgJzwpLP82iSagzMnoZkE",,"AF1QipP5vrwhBI-BftuygSXoPONCJy3qj9DBsas-BlJM, AF1QipPr_b7QjqPdj6PX54zjqVQx8DDrbnAtC9umNjUX, AF1QipPIB8TFPuuTTVZSpgqTwTv25dbK_WtMUskR-fkV, AF1QipOzdA7gg9RYO4wOLTlbVv7W4ZLGJsD88gytm5dz, AF1QipOEQbQrXTmqAvr3qS9qFubDNrQg9UR6nfXNMTDp, AF1QipOotZD7S-6V3XjW6Lv7edCx6-4l_lkRF5VEvPuZ, AF1QipOGtdczbNeMj3insM9-ZNdIWYX1hUbbqht-OmKy, AF1QipPA8mvaNaOHN6G6jMu0TgG54jbFCOtAs6JlD957, AF1QipN9sxEmnGJ-tU0-6YM9zVWBA2c5UK4RBiObSb3K, AF1QipNYNB8yy1u6ZMD-n_XQlymHx7VxGp3SpriKihXD, AF1QipOAqny2OO2aBlftPnOLWASJ-wwMJXNDDF0AWYGa, AF1QipN8oKdHTr50vrjix1NBhkN2xCKUm5SzS8kWGMsO, AF1QipMC6JclXcWlf3Rq5Y0P1-KkhyxBcOTeiZUVEF9v, AF1QipNRtBGthfFHQcETqQjzzjrIIiQpaOq9txAnuV6v, AF1QipN4ztN-0CEQswdpVZKKgJzwpLP82iSagzMnoZkE",,,,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURwNklUdmNBEAE!2m1!1s0x0:0xf1592407377b9781!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIDp6ITvcA%7CCgwI8ZGOpwYQqPmH7wI%7C?hl=en-US,2.0,1692633329.0,08/21/2023 15:55:29,0.0,-1055773024227453055,156.0,141.0,567.0,1445.0,4258.0,,,,,,,,Public holiday,Up to 10 min,No,,,,,

Atmosphere and Vibes: 4/5
The establishment is spacious, modern, and trendy, with great music on Friday nights. I would have given a 5/5 rating if the music volume was slightly lower until 9 pm, and if there was a dedicated space for dancing. 💃🕺🏾

Food: 5/5
Top-notch, large portions, and fast service. The food served five people in just 22 minutes. Appetizers arrived 8 minutes after we placed our order. The Jollof is top notch.

Service: 4/5
The staff is attentive, patient, and always available. I would have given a 4/5 if the bill-paying process was a bit faster.

Conclusion:
I will definitely be back and will bring more hungry friends and authentic Nigerian food aficionados.""",https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMy2ezjkndJN1VeDIe5IscxLvc8OKrgB08XoHZx,"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMy2ezjkndJN1VeDIe5IscxLvc8OKrgB08XoHZx, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNDFLiSGOdP7c3SMvB2ZuW_ytxw9kDuogNPeKig, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOovqex5qSBOK9tG8MANY0nLbS-XxKdpQpXl-rn, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMZ1xc7M4F0c4JRbeLAQc8RIlCFgXV4wrBQrG5v, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO0Wvec_3osSUTimN5kr8LkDtzZYetL8nSJMZ7U, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO1p34bbNKwm0KBivofkdQS394YbpowM7qJIUUQ, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMWmaBraxTq8O5Wziuc4j4pFK-PuZplWsPj1A4a, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMo_UTdAPCuaF-CNH3_RAczXV9smDHzk0OLKOh8, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNv6VBgxdq-pfQ7HyBmOQ-vIfPf2uiCW30XaJmq, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM3jMQwZb10nQr-jlN-U_Cexk2KSbyrryQ7TZ36, https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPDsH30_47fpnbS1u5bUPpyf8v6Or4bMcXG_WLz",,"AF1QipMy2ezjkndJN1VeDIe5IscxLvc8OKrgB08XoHZx, AF1QipNDFLiSGOdP7c3SMvB2ZuW_ytxw9kDuogNPeKig, AF1QipOovqex5qSBOK9tG8MANY0nLbS-XxKdpQpXl-rn, AF1QipMZ1xc7M4F0c4JRbeLAQc8RIlCFgXV4wrBQrG5v, AF1QipO0Wvec_3osSUTimN5kr8LkDtzZYetL8nSJMZ7U, AF1QipO1p34bbNKwm0KBivofkdQS394YbpowM7qJIUUQ, AF1QipMWmaBraxTq8O5Wziuc4j4pFK-PuZplWsPj1A4a, AF1QipMo_UTdAPCuaF-CNH3_RAczXV9smDHzk0OLKOh8, AF1QipNv6VBgxdq-pfQ7HyBmOQ-vIfPf2uiCW30XaJmq, AF1QipM3jMQwZb10nQr-jlN-U_Cexk2KSbyrryQ7TZ36, AF1QipPDsH30_47fpnbS1u5bUPpyf8v6Or4bMcXG_WLz",😆 🤣.

The layout and interior was just a wee bit nicer than the standard Nigerian restaurant look or aesthetic.
The lady who attended to us looked tired but she was smiling through it and that is huge to me. I could eat and enjoy my food without a smile but the effort meant or means a whole lot in my opinion.
The washroom was really clean.
The water for rinsing/washing our hands was nice and warm. Little things like that count.
NOW THE KOKO (main thing). The nkwobi was BOMB. Not bones funny muscle-y meat…nice good sized meat and delicious!
I had Afang and that was really good too (you can see that I didn’t remember to take pictures… e get why 😄). We got the grilled tilapia to go and feedback we got is that it was really nice. I will definitely be visiting again. Oh! And wait time was not bad at all.

Atmosphere and Vibes: 4/5

Food: 5/5
Top-notch, large portions, and fast service. The food served five people in just 22 minutes. Appetizers arrived 8 minutes after we placed our order. The Jollof is top notch.

The layout and interior was just a wee bit nicer than the standard Nigerian restaurant look or aesthetic.
The lady who attended to us looked tired but she was smiling through it and that is huge to me. I could eat and enjoy my food without a smile but the effort meant or means a whole lot in my opinion.
The washroom was really clean.
The water for rinsing/washing our hands was nice and warm. Little things like that count.
NOW THE KOKO (main thing). The nkwobi was BOMB. Not bones funny muscle-y meat…nice good sized meat and delicious!
I had Afang and that was really good too (you can see that I didn’t remember to take pictures… e get why 😄). We got the grilled tilapia to go and feedback we got is that it was really nice. I will definitely be visiting again. Oh! And wait time was not bad at all.

Service, food, atmosphere was mediocre at best. Its just disappointing.

We are new in Calgary and decided to give this place a try. We ordered the poundo yam & okra (see pic of the okra), rice & ofada, and pepper soup. On arrival, there was no one at the register and we had to wait about 10minutes & it took my partner hollering and waving to get a response. I specifically asked if the ofada was the green or the red one of which the lady that attended to me answered that it was green. Lo and behold it looked more like red pepper stew. The Okra was the one that we thought was pretty poor. From what i know, okra was a ‘draw’ soup but what we were served was surely not Okra. I made this known to the lady that served us that I was surprised by this. I took a couple of scoops to feed myself and my 22month old but could no longer take it. I brought it to the attention of the ladies (1 who i believe is the owner). Her response was ‘so what should i do, what should i do?). To avoid confrontation, i requested to just have the assorted meat and we were ready to leave. I asked for egusi soup instead and guess she had a change of heart and provided the egusi as an exchange. This was gracious on her part. The egusi was a bit better. But i could clearly hear the owner grumbling and speaking in the kitchen about me/ the incident. The other lady said I should have ordered ogbono if I wanted draw soup. Welp! It seemed like a joke to be honest. Its just sad that as much as we try to support our own, we are met with so much disappointment and poor service. Our Nigerian food is very expensive and wished we got more value and better experience out of it. Will not be returning.

This little Somali Restaurant lured me because I was traveling with my friend who has a limited diet...but goat is on her allowed foods list. We have eaten at numerous East African restaurants in Edmonton but were traveling through Calgary and needed to find a similar restaurant.

On the surface, Luubann is not in an ideal neighborhood and parking is hard to find. It is such a little unassuming dining establishment that one might think it's not worth a stop.  And it's certainly not a fancy place.

We would not have normally stopped there if it wasn't because of the diet of my friend. But I am so glad we did.  The lady at the front was so kind and sweet.  We ordered a goat and a beef and we were thrilled. And to top it all off, she brought us two soups for free.

I am so glad to share this review and the five stars.

This little Somali Restaurant lured me because I was traveling with my friend who has a limited diet...but goat is on her allowed foods list. We have eaten at numerous East African restaurants in Edmonton but were traveling through Calgary and needed to find a similar restaurant.

On the surface, Luubann is not in an ideal neighborhood and parking is hard to find. It is such a little unassuming dining establishment that one might think it's not worth a stop.  And it's certainly not a fancy place.

We would not have normally stopped there if it wasn't because of the diet of my friend. But I am so glad we did.  The lady at the front was so kind and sweet.  We ordered a goat and a beef and we were thrilled. And to top it all off, she brought us two soups for free.

I am so glad to share this review and the five stars.

This little Somali Restaurant lured me because I was traveling with my friend who has a limited diet...but goat is on her allowed foods list. We have eaten at numerous East African restaurants in Edmonton but were traveling through Calgary and needed to find a similar restaurant.

On the surface, Luubann is not in an ideal neighborhood and parking is hard to find. It is such a little unassuming dining establishment that one might think it's not worth a stop.  And it's certainly not a fancy place.

We would not have normally stopped there if it wasn't because of the diet of my friend. But I am so glad we did.  The lady at the front was so kind and sweet.  We ordered a goat and a beef and we were thrilled. And to top it all off, she brought us two soups for free.

Overall, I’ll come again, cause food was good.

Service, food, atmosphere was mediocre at best. Its just disappointing.

We are new in Calgary and decided to give this place a try. We ordered the poundo yam & okra (see pic of the okra), rice & ofada, and pepper soup. On arrival, there was no one at the register and we had to wait about 10minutes & it took my partner hollering and waving to get a response. I specifically asked if the ofada was the green or the red one of which the lady that attended to me answered that it was green. Lo and behold it looked more like red pepper stew. The Okra was the one that we thought was pretty poor. From what i know, okra was a ‘draw’ soup but what we were served was surely not Okra. I made this known to the lady that served us that I was surprised by this. I took a couple of scoops to feed myself and my 22month old but could no longer take it. I brought it to the attention of the ladies (1 who i believe is the owner). Her response was ‘so what should i do, what should i do?). To avoid confrontation, i requested to just have the assorted meat and we were ready to leave. I asked for egusi soup instead and guess she had a change of heart and provided the egusi as an exchange. This was gracious on her part. The egusi was a bit better. But i could clearly hear the owner grumbling and speaking in the kitchen about me/ the incident. The other lady said I should have ordered ogbono if I wanted draw soup. Welp! It seemed like a joke to be honest. Its just sad that as much as we try to support our own, we are met with so much disappointment and poor service. Our Nigerian food is very expensive and wished we got more value and better experience out of it. Will not be returning. Order the Okra at your own risk!",https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOMWbIqKsFmF-B-ya0X942RGWtINyZq-nqmtQFW,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOMWbIqKsFmF-B-ya0X942RGWtINyZq-nqmtQFW,,AF1QipOMWbIqKsFmF-B-ya0X942RGWtINyZq-nqmtQFW,,,,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNKOVAtQ1ZREAE!2m1!1s0x0:0xb169ab451460f69a!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgICJ9P-CVQ%7CCgwI2ebOpAYQiN7PnAM%7C?hl=en-US,1.0,1687401305.0,06/22/2023 02:35:05,1.0,-5662806743258696038,62.0,6.0,22.0,31.0,97.0,,1,,,1,1,,,,,,,,,

This little Somali Restaurant lured me because I was traveling with my friend who has a limited diet...but goat is on her allowed foods list. We have eaten at numerous East African restaurants in Edmonton but were traveling through Calgary and needed to find a similar restaurant.

On the surface, Luubann is not in an ideal neighborhood and parking is hard to find. It is such a little unassuming dining establishment that one might think it's not worth a stop.  And it's certainly not a fancy place.

We would not have normally stopped there if it wasn't because of the diet of my friend. But I am so glad we did.  The lady at the front was so kind and sweet.  We ordered a goat and a beef and we were thrilled. And to top it all off, she brought us two soups for free.

I am so glad to share this review and the five stars.

Service, food, atmosphere was mediocre at best. Its just disappointing.

We are new in Calgary and decided to give this place a try. We ordered the poundo yam & okra (see pic of the okra), rice & ofada, and pepper soup. On arrival, there was no one at the register and we had to wait about 10minutes & it took my partner hollering and waving to get a response. I specifically asked if the ofada was the green or the red one of which the lady that attended to me answered that it was green. Lo and behold it looked more like red pepper stew. The Okra was the one that we thought was pretty poor. From what i know, okra was a ‘draw’ soup but what we were served was surely not Okra. I made this known to the lady that served us that I was surprised by this. I took a couple of scoops to feed myself and my 22month old but could no longer take it. I brought it to the attention of the ladies (1 who i believe is the owner). Her response was ‘so what should i do, what should i do?). To avoid confrontation, i requested to just have the assorted meat and we were ready to leave. I asked for egusi soup instead and guess she had a change of heart and provided the egusi as an exchange. This was gracious on her part. The egusi was a bit better. But i could clearly hear the owner grumbling and speaking in the kitchen about me/ the incident. The other lady said I should have ordered ogbono if I wanted draw soup. Welp! It seemed like a joke to be honest. Its just sad that as much as we try to support our own, we are met with so much disappointment and poor service. Our Nigerian food is very expensive and wished we got more value and better experience out of it. Will not be returning. Order the Okra at your own risk!",https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOMWbIqKsFmF-B-ya0X942RGWtINyZq-nqmtQFW,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOMWbIqKsFmF-B-ya0X942RGWtINyZq-nqmtQFW,,AF1QipOMWbIqKsFmF-B-ya0X942RGWtINyZq-nqmtQFW,,,,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNKOVAtQ1ZREAE!2m1!1s0x0:0xb169ab451460f69a!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgICJ9P-CVQ%7CCgwI2ebOpAYQiN7PnAM%7C?hl=en-US,1.0,1687401305.0,06/22/2023 02:35:05,1.0,-5662806743258696038,62.0,6.0,22.0,31.0,97.0,,1,,,1,1,,,,,,,,,

This little Somali Restaurant lured me because I was traveling with my friend who has a limited diet...but goat is on her allowed foods list. We have eaten at numerous East African restaurants in Edmonton but were traveling through Calgary and needed to find a similar restaurant.

On the surface, Luubann is not in an ideal neighborhood and parking is hard to find. It is such a little unassuming dining establishment that one might think it's not worth a stop.  And it's certainly not a fancy place.

We would not have normally stopped there if it wasn't because of the diet of my friend. But I am so glad we did.  The lady at the front was so kind and sweet.  We ordered a goat and a beef and we were thrilled. And to top it all off, she brought us two soups for free.

I am so glad to share this review and the five stars.

Service, food, atmosphere was mediocre at best. Its just disappointing.

We are new in Calgary and decided to give this place a try. We ordered the poundo yam & okra (see pic of the okra), rice & ofada, and pepper soup. On arrival, there was no one at the register and we had to wait about 10minutes & it took my partner hollering and waving to get a response. I specifically asked if the ofada was the green or the red one of which the lady that attended to me answered that it was green. Lo and behold it looked more like red pepper stew. The Okra was the one that we thought was pretty poor. From what i know, okra was a ‘draw’ soup but what we were served was surely not Okra. I made this known to the lady that served us that I was surprised by this. I took a couple of scoops to feed myself and my 22month old but could no longer take it. I brought it to the attention of the ladies (1 who i believe is the owner). Her response was ‘so what should i do, what should i do?). To avoid confrontation, i requested to just have the assorted meat and we were ready to leave. I asked for egusi soup instead and guess she had a change of heart and provided the egusi as an exchange. This was gracious on her part. The egusi was a bit better. But i could clearly hear the owner grumbling and speaking in the kitchen about me/ the incident. The other lady said I should have ordered ogbono if I wanted draw soup. Welp! It seemed like a joke to be honest. Its just sad that as much as we try to support our own, we are met with so much disappointment and poor service. Our Nigerian food is very expensive and wished we got more value and better experience out of it. Will not be returning. Order the Okra at your own risk!",https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOMWbIqKsFmF-B-ya0X942RGWtINyZq-nqmtQFW,https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOMWbIqKsFmF-B-ya0X942RGWtINyZq-nqmtQFW,,AF1QipOMWbIqKsFmF-B-ya0X942RGWtINyZq-nqmtQFW,,,,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNKOVAtQ1ZREAE!2m1!1s0x0:0xb169ab451460f69a!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgICJ9P-CVQ%7CCgwI2ebOpAYQiN7PnAM%7C?hl=en-US,1.0,1687401305.0,06/22/2023 02:35:05,1.0,-5662806743258696038,62.0,6.0,22.0,31.0,97.0,,1,,,1,1,,,,,,,,,

This little Somali Restaurant lured me because I was traveling with my friend who has a limited diet...but goat is on her allowed foods list. We have eaten at numerous East African restaurants in Edmonton but were traveling through Calgary and needed to find a similar restaurant.

On the surface, Luubann is not in an ideal neighborhood and parking is hard to find. It is such a little unassuming dining establishment that one might think it's not worth a stop.  And it's certainly not a fancy place.

We would not have normally stopped there if it wasn't because of the diet of my friend. But I am so glad we did.  The lady at the front was so kind and sweet.  We ordered a goat and a beef and we were thrilled. And to top it all off, she brought us two soups for free.

This little Somali Restaurant lured me because I was traveling with my friend who has a limited diet...but goat is on her allowed foods list. We have eaten at numerous East African restaurants in Edmonton but were traveling through Calgary and needed to find a similar restaurant.

On the surface, Luubann is not in an ideal neighborhood and parking is hard to find. It is such a little unassuming dining establishment that one might think it's not worth a stop.  And it's certainly not a fancy place.

We would not have normally stopped there if it wasn't because of the diet of my friend. But I am so glad we did.  The lady at the front was so kind and sweet.  We ordered a goat and a beef and we were thrilled. And to top it all off, she brought us two soups for free.

This little Somali Restaurant lured me because I was traveling with my friend who has a limited diet...but goat is on her allowed foods list. We have eaten at numerous East African restaurants in Edmonton but were traveling through Calgary and needed to find a similar restaurant.

On the surface, Luubann is not in an ideal neighborhood and parking is hard to find. It is such a little unassuming dining establishment that one might think it's not worth a stop.  And it's certainly not a fancy place.

We would not have normally stopped there if it wasn't because of the diet of my friend. But I am so glad we did.  The lady at the front was so kind and sweet.  We ordered a goat and a beef and we were thrilled. And to top it all off, she brought us two soups for free.
