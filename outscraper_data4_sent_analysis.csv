African Variety Store,You will find Ethiopian traditional items and raw materials (teff and wheat) for Injera and bread
African Variety Store,"According to AHS found dead mouse in store with mouse dropping, meat thawing at room temperature. Foodborne pathogens multiply quickly at room temperature. With food born pathogens they do not neccesarily have a smell or taste off to be bad. Please learn from this."
African Variety Store,"Good selection of ethiopian  species , grain, cultural items. You can also find   meat , farm chicken and whole lamb"
African Variety Store,Very friendly people from my home country ethiopian.  Always good service and friendly community.
African Variety Store,It's best place to get Ethiopian spices and food staffs
African Variety Store,It was a great fresh whole lamb
African Variety Store,"Their berbere is not the right one,,,,"
African Choice Market,"I went to return an item (white seed melon) I bought less than 10 days with proof of my receipt. The owner of the store told me I wouldn‚Äôt get a refund due to ‚Äúso called food handling‚Äù. This was a dry product in its original packaging and unopened. The product had no expiry date on the package when I bought it, the receipt had no return policy whatsoever. So what gives them the right to tell me about handling?

This is a store I have seen expired palm oils on the shelf severally but the store owner had the audacity to preach to me about food handling. I want to point out the double standard and hypocrisy. I‚Äôm definitely boycotting that store but will file a complaint to Consumer Protection Services. Shame on them!"
African Choice Market,"Very nice atmosphere, the madam there was very polite and the prices were really good. I will definitely be coming here again"
African Choice Market,"The 2 stars is for Great staff, 0 star for bad product. I bought African Choice palm Oil ended up ruining my food. Palm Oil in bean porridge turned out vegetable oil in beans with bad taste and smell. My good intentions of providing good food for my family was tinted badly by an African Choice brand palm Oil wasting by hard earned resources.üò°"
African Choice Market,"I have been a long time customer of this store and have always had great experience. However, recently, with the change in staffing my experiences has been less than pleasant. Today, I attended to do my regular shopping as usual and noticed that their prices has increase drastically. I was buying this items for my mom, who is not in Calgary. I bought a pepper, even though there was no price anywhere the item was located. It occurred to me after leaving the store to check with my mom whether or not she would be fine with the 10 dollar price on such a small amount of pepper. She said not to buy it and to return it. I returned to the store less than 5 minutes later only for them to be telling me that they are not doing returns due to covid 19. Which is understandable. However, this needs to be made aware to all customers when arriving at the door not behind your counter where no one ever thought to look. further, there is nothing preventing your store associates  mention that to every customers to further reinforce that information. After the store associate realized that I was going to stay there as long as it takes for her to refund my money, she did. This experience left a bad taste in my mouth and would like to see improvement."
African Choice Market,"Being a business within other businesses, parking was a nightmare! The store manager was such a warm and friendly lady, helped with the shopping experience. The aisles are pretty small and could be really inconvenient for multiple shoppers. I had a good experience at the store, I won't mind shopping there again."
African Choice Market,They have garri and other African food products. You will enjoy visiting here.
African Choice Market,"Hours of operation is bad, open at 11? At least 10 would be great. Especially for those of us who like to start cooking in the morning, if it‚Äôs something you need from here buy it ahead lol
The comment below about $10 pepper lol me too my bf bought it and later told me the price, I screamed! African stores always have no refund policies (what is that aboutüôÑ) They lied about Covid reason and plus the peppers are in the package. if superstore would take something I touched back, why can‚Äôt they?
Overall service is great though, just need to improve the way they run certain things!"
African Choice Market,"First time ordering to deliver. First- the customer service is quite excellent. Ms Bukola who i‚Äôm assuming is the owner was very pleasant through the ordering process & quite patient as we had a long list of items. She was also very swift & attentive. On delivery day, i appreciated being kept up to date with delivery status and I was pleasantly surprised when the items came. Very well packaged and presentable. This was a valentines day gift so it was so easy to send off to the recipient. We have also visited the NE store a few times & its always been a great experience. Pleasant service, clean store, no funny smells and all round A*. Kudos to your team. We just moved to Calgary from another province and this is now our go to spot :)"

African Shop Calgary (E.F.C. Afro-Caribbean Inc),"Our one stop shop for everything we need from an African store. Food is fresh and authentic, customer service is top notch. Best part is, it‚Äôs only about a 13 minutes drive from Chestermere so a quick drive is all it takes for me to make some delish mealsüòãüòã."
African Shop Calgary (E.F.C. Afro-Caribbean Inc),"I came here to pick up an item, but ended up loading my whole trunk with goods. Excellent and professional customer service. A very welcoming, family-oriented shop. Lots of varieties with competitive prices. Exceptionally clean and healthy environment. Lots of free parking. An extra star for the shop's delivery service. Cool!"

Sage Meadows Market African Store,The garri there sell is full of sand my advised to everyone is to avoid that garri please this garri can give you appendicitis be careful
Sage Meadows Market African Store,"Good store. I buy regularly there. However, there is an attendant there, as at May, 2023. Very unwelcoming. Seem like a frustrated fellow. Terrible customer service. I don't intend to return there anytime soon"
Sage Meadows Market African Store,"BEWARE!
Honestly so disappointed in this store.
I have been cheated more than twice and most times they claim its a mistake. They knowingly cheat you and add to the bills you have and when you find out, they claim its a mistake.
The first time this happened to me, i thought it was actually an error on their part but when it kept repeating itself, i knew they were aware of what they were doing.
please make sure to check your receipts properly when you buy things from this store and most importantly look at the price before you go to the counter so they don't add to it, as they are fond of doing this.

EDIT:

They now have a pos system which issues receipts and more transparent system, hence I have come back to edit review."
Sage Meadows Market African Store,Unfriendly / unwelcoming store attendant (the lady). She needs to do better. Store is neat though and we'll organized
Sage Meadows Market African Store,"This store will cheat you!! The staff always inflate prices of the items, it has happened to me thrice. I will always call her out before she corrects it, don‚Äôt even get me started on the rude man there. Recently they‚Äôve started removing price tags from their products so you have no way of knowing the actual price and then they can tell you whatever they like. I won‚Äôt be shopping here anymore and I‚Äôd advise you not to."
Sage Meadows Market African Store,"Be careful in this store they inflate bills so always check your receipts.I have experienced it twice in this store and the woman claimed it was a mistake.Always check your receipt with the things you bought.The first time I went to this store a lady came back to complain that she was charged for pepper twice,the owner screamed mistake and refunded ,I didn‚Äôt believe her so I stylishly followed  the woman who told me she has done it to her before.I just called the person that referred me to this store and the guy said he has experienced it too although not from the woman but her staff and they never refunded the money to him.I will post on groups too to create awareness this is so bad.Yesterday I bought things and she inflated my bill with 5 dollars as usual and also screamed mistake üò≥,although she refunded me But I was so angry that I said I will create awareness on this.As you can see from my receipt she added bread twice and the 5 dollars was given back to me when I went back."
Sage Meadows Market African Store,Nice and wonderful store to shop all your African glorcery needs .
Agape African Store,"Stocked up for all your African foodstuffs, groceries  & accessories. The attendant is quite cordial and respectful"
Agape African Store,Good customer service. Products not to overpriced. And they sell ofio
Agape African Store,Nice store to shop for Nigerian food items. Smells like home and I miss it a lot. Lovely lady who owns the store. Fairly priced I would say considering it's imported stuff.
Agape African Store,"Love that it's a one stop-shop for African items - food, hair, snacks, weaves/hair extensions etc"
Agape African Store,"Nice place for all you Nigerian foodstuffs, with very friendly staff"
Agape African Store,"Nice store, variety of African foods and products, from hair extensions weave to clothing's and cosmetics"
Agape African Store,Warm reception. Very helpful ladies. They assisted with brainstorming about choices available. Will recommend the store and go back again
MJ'S African Food Store,"If you want the true taste of African foods.MJ'S is your shop,frozen products like beans,matoke,green maize,vegetable, fish list is endless.Very High quality, tastes as fresh as those from the farm when cooked.
Great customer service updates on new products on arrival of shipments.
She never disappoints!!.
Please make MJ'S your favorite store."
MJ'S African Food Store,"Hello guys, Here is where u can get ur favorite African foods. Matoke, bananas, plant eggs, peas, spinach, sweet potatoes etc."
MJ'S African Food Store,Shout out to @‚Å®MJ's Cuisine & Convenience Store for having all the ingredients to prepare one of our traditional Burundian dishes #agatokenubwishazanirengarenga. I sure will be coming back soon. Especially for that #amamesapalmola from #Burundi. The best quality I have used so far.
MJ'S African Food Store,"It would have been a good place to shop Some of East African Foods but their customer service is very poor. Attendants are very rude and arrogant not friendly at all , the only reason as to why I go back it‚Äôs because it‚Äôs the only place to get some East African products in Calgary. They are only friendly if you are from Burundi or Rwanda period."
MJ'S African Food Store,I LOVE that there is somewhere in Calgary where I can get authentic East African food. Excellent service and amazing food. :)
ugonwas.ca,"I ordered 4 items from ugonwa's- all arrived in good condition, and service was prompt and professional. I went to pick up, and the packaging of the items was so neat and everything was put in a taped small box even though they were not being shipped."
ugonwas.ca,"My experience shopping with Ugonwas was superb, prompt delivery and professionalism. I bought cases of yams and until I exhausted all of my stock none of them went bad. This shows that the quality control in their warehouse is top notch! I'll definitely be coming back for more."
ugonwas.ca,"My experience shopping at Ugonwas has been amazing. First off,  love the flat rate shipping, works for me perfectly! Secondly they have a wide variety of my Naija items in stock from frozen ugwu, to bean flour, to pap, to beans, yams, dudu osun, burger King, palm oil, pepper, pomo, etc.Thirdly the items arrive within a short time frame all the way to BC and well packaged for the ride (including frozen items that comes with reusable ice bag and ice). The customer service is also top notch. Overall, I am happy with Ugonwas level of service and products."
ugonwas.ca,"Grace, the CEO of Ugonwas has demonstrated her understanding of putting the customers and consumers first. She will deliver products to you at a competitive price regardless of where you are in Calgary and it's environs. I highly recommend this store for your quality, affordable produce and items."
ugonwas.ca,OMG!!!!! I have never been this impressed before by African stores because they always have things incomplete! You literally have to drive to more than one store to be fulfilled but Ugonwa.ca is Naija at your door step and very affordable!!! Packaging is superb! Am EXTREMELY HAPPY AND SATISFIED WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND!!!!
ugonwas.ca,Shipping was very fast and my package arrived earlier than expected. Everything was neatly packaged and in great condition. I also appreciated the updates I received from the time I placed my order till it arrived at my door step. Customer service is A++++
ugonwas.ca,Prompt response and accurate delivery dates. The bitters was really helpful and thanks for your recommendation. Excellent Customer service is at its peak at the Ugonwas.
Stockland African Market,"My favorite Africa store in NE Calgary. They are usually helpful, not rude and prices are comparable. They have almost everything you may be looking for to cook African soups or delicacies. I got some Nigerian food like garri, achi, oha leaves, yams , palmoil, elubo, semolina , iru (locust beans) etc I like the fact that she helps her customer get parking space."
Stockland African Market,"Clean, spacious well laid our store. Excellent customer service. I am Cameroon and my hubby is Nigerian...and they had every ingredient and condiment (on both sides) that I needed."
Stockland African Market,"I purchased a 2kg custard powder four days ago July 27, 2022 and discovered it was expiring August 2022. I called store August 1,2022 to make the complaint and was told there's nothing that can be done since it was bought in July. Worst customer service ever!"
Stockland African Market,"When you're looking for African food items, this is the place to be! They're always super friendly and respectful. When I'm in the store, I always feel like I'm with my family, because the owner and her husband always call me their sister. They will offer to help you throughout.
I was there the other day, a guy came in to buy a bottle of water, but when he checked his pocket, he didn't have coins, the owner told the guy that it's ok he can have the water. It's the little things that matters."
Stockland African Market,This is a one stop shop for all your spices and ingredients that you will need to get that taste of African dishes and the staff are always willing to help you get what you need.
Stockland African Market,"The lady does not care about food safety. She cut meat, and fixed the meat-cutting machine(which broke down) while she was cutting the meat. She did all of these without changing her gloves.  Imagine all the oil, grime and dirt contaminating the meat she's cutting. If that wasn't enough,  she brought out a dirty rag that had lying on the floor to clean up.
When the machine broke down, she did not think it was necessary to apologise to the customer for the delay.
food safety = 0
customer service = 0"
Stockland African Market,So I went there today for the first time and met this very pleasant woman. I don't know if she owns the shop but she was very welcoming and friendly to all customers including myself. Definitely going back again and again.
De Chosen African Market,"Someone is tampering with this product. The packaging is very questionable. It is not ogbono. It is a brown starchy powder filler that's that is 95 percent filler...in my opinion. It's also pastey and forms into pieces of starch at the bottom. It does not draw. It's brown flour.

This can possibly harm someone if they have allergies.

I will edit this post with a YouTube link to show how it is in real time."
De Chosen African Market,"****BEWARE OF SCAMMERS****

I went to the location to purchase a new Andis T professional beard and hair trimmer.  Originally the location had 2 in stock when i went in to purchase the razor and i chose the first box on display.  After leaving with my purchase, I hadn't considered opening the box to check the product until i reached my next destination and thats when i realized the razor was used, rusted and broken.  I returned to the location right away to ask for an exchange as the product i purchased was damaged and clearly well used.  Instead of agreeing to an exchange, the employee refused and stated that i should have opened the box before leaving the store and that she actually believed i had taken the ""newly"" purchased razor and replaced it with my own used and broken razor... in that case, why would i have asked for an exchange.  When she refused to exchange the damaged product, i then asked for a refund which she then told me she was not authorized to give and that i would need to speak with the owner who was conveniently not at the location and could not be reached at that time.

This is an ongoing scam in Africa and after speaking with the owner the next day, she told me that she needed a week to investigate what may have happened.  These locations provide African food and products and ive seen these razors sitting on the shelf collecting dust, i chose to purchase the pruduct so i could support a black owned small business when i could have easily purchased the razor from Amazon.  I left the damaged and used razor with them and gave up on getting any money returned to me, i really just want others to be weary and aware that it may happen to them as well."
De Chosen African Market,"This store stocks expired products. I bought beans flour from them, and the dates had been cleaned off. You can still read the imprints (barely) on the package, and this product had been expired for almost 10 months. I encourage customers to report them to the city when they notice food tampering - it doesn‚Äôt take up to five minutes.
I was going to use the product to prepare something for my 7 month old at home - this could have caused food poisoning or worse! I understand that they need to make a profit, but this shouldn‚Äôt be at the cost of their clients‚Äô health."
De Chosen African Market,"De Chosen has a number of products that will appeal to folks that have stayed in Africa (most especially Nigeria). The prices are a bit above average but the cashiers are really nice, they make it worthwhile"
De Chosen African Market,The lady with Caribbean accent have a ventricular voice. I wonder who hurt her. She act like the world is against her. The other mama will make your day If not for the mama I won't go there again life is too short to deal with unhappy people.
De Chosen African Market,I was so impressed by the service I received today. The lady that attended to me was very patient and kind. She helped parked all my item so neatly that it was easy for me to move them to my truck as I cam from Lethbridge. Thanks so much.
De Chosen African Market,The lady in the store was super rude to me when I showed up to pick a friends package. Her behaviour changed when I shopped $1000 all together. I drove 33min on the high way to the shop and couldn't afford driving many more minutes to search for another store that's why I went ahead to shop there. But am sure I wouldn't go back there next time. If I were the owner I would have fired her right away
Fradu Caf√© South African BBQ Ltd.,Super tasty food with interesting flavors! The chakala sausage in a roll was definitely a star! This spot is hidden within the Avenida food market and it's definitely one of the gems that I think people need to check out!
Fradu Caf√© South African BBQ Ltd.,"The owner (Frank) is an amazing person and it was really nice to experience that genuine kind South African hospitality! Knowing it was my birthday he went out of his way to get cake at no charge! Boerwors was amazing and highly recommended as well as the Peri Peri fries!
We will be back!"
Fradu Caf√© South African BBQ Ltd.,"Wow. First time going here, great service and very nice people. Best beef ribs i‚Äôve ever had, fries and coleslaw also amazing. Will be back and recommend to everyone!! #gangstalicoussznbebe"
Fradu Caf√© South African BBQ Ltd.,"Food and service was amazing! I ordered here for the first time for takeout meals for my 40th birthday. I was craving a taste from home and wanted to share it with my Canadian friends and family. Frank was very quick to respond and give recommendations for my party. His responses were prompt and it was a real pleasure communicating with him. I ordered a couple of mega Shias-Nyama platters,  and some other side dishes like fries and beef ribs. Everything was delicious! Everyone loved the chakalaka, boerewors and the beef ribs were so tender. There was a great selection on the platters, with rice and gravy and chicken and coleslaw as well amongst other things.  Frank even went the extra mile and organized delivery for me as we are just outside of Calgary in Airdrie, I appreciated that so much. Frank and team thank you so much for the delicious food, and making my birthday extra special! I can't wait to come in for a dine in experience with my family in the future."
Fradu Caf√© South African BBQ Ltd.,I experienced the delicious taste of South African with my family once again. I'll be coming back over and over again. The prices are very affordable as well.
Fradu Caf√© South African BBQ Ltd.,"1stI time ordering.  I was looking forward to your food, as saw on uber eats. I would say the quality of the food seemed good. But restaurants, ruin the experience with CHEAP cardboard containers!. Why why? All the food delivered was completely soggy. Learn how to package items to keeps fries crispy too. Everything from the lettuce on the bun to the coleslaw was melded into a soggy experience. Very disappointing! Especially when you pay over 30 bucks."
Fradu Caf√© South African BBQ Ltd.,"Fradu 3 Meats was a great way to try different kinds of BBQ meats and flavours. It did not disappoint! The pork had a delicious char, the chicken was perfectly done and accompanied by a savoury lemon sauce, and boerewors is a must try! Very authenticly made, seasoned, and grilled! Just wish there was more. Like everything else, the beef ribs are perfectly cooked with an irresistible sticky BBQ sauce. This was easily some of the best food I have ever had!"
Delish Dining,"Finally, a place where you can enjoy delicious, reasonably priced, fast, and generously portioned Nigerian food in Calgary.

Atmosphere and Vibes: 4/5
The establishment is spacious, modern, and trendy, with great music on Friday nights. I would have given a 5/5 rating if the music volume was slightly lower until 9 pm, and if there was a dedicated space for dancing. üíÉüï∫üèæ

Food: 5/5
Top-notch, large portions, and fast service. The food served five people in just 22 minutes. Appetizers arrived 8 minutes after we placed our order. The Jollof is top notch.

Service: 4/5
The staff is attentive, patient, and always available. I would have given a 4/5 if the bill-paying process was a bit faster.

Conclusion:
I will definitely be back and will bring more hungry friends and authentic Nigerian food aficionados."""
Delish Dining,"Had the Pounded Yam and Egusi soup for the first time today. Food was awesome. Staff was very friendly! Love the atmosphere and music. Would highly recommend. Eating with my hands was a new treat. No phones, no distractions just enjoying the wonderful Nigerian food. Debbie was a wonderful server"
Delish Dining,Delish Dining is our go to Nigerian restaurant in Calgary. Food is so delicious with varieties to order from and prices are affordable. I enjoy myself to fullest any time I visit. My best dish is their Isi-ewu and Abacha. Correct food üëç
Delish Dining,"In the immortal words of Anthony Bourdain, ‚ÄúFood is everything we are. It‚Äôs an extension of nationalist feeling, ethnic feeling, your personal history, your province, your region, your tribe, your grandma.‚Äù

The abacha and nkowbi I had left me feeling nostalgic.

Service: I called the order and was told it would be ready in 20mins. I arrived exactly 25mins later and still waited another 20mins. Safe to say, this would not be the place to go if pressed for time.

However I will be back as the food was delicious."
Delish Dining,"Visiting Calgary and decided to find the closest Nigerian restaurant and a few came up but we decided to go with this.
The layout and interior was just a wee bit nicer than the standard Nigerian restaurant look or aesthetic.
The lady who attended to us looked tired but she was smiling through it and that is huge to me. I could eat and enjoy my food without a smile but the effort meant or means a whole lot in my opinion.
The washroom was really clean.
The water for rinsing/washing our hands was nice and warm. Little things like that count.
NOW THE KOKO (main thing). The nkwobi was BOMB. Not bones funny muscle-y meat‚Ä¶nice good sized meat and delicious!
I had Afang and that was really good too (you can see that I didn‚Äôt remember to take pictures‚Ä¶ e get why üòÑ). We got the grilled tilapia to go and feedback we got is that it was really nice. I will definitely be visiting again. Oh! And wait time was not bad at all.
Nkwobi came within 10mins of us being seated and the main meals came before we had finished eating the nkwobi."
Delish Dining,"I was embarrassed by the owner and staff because they assumed I made an order which I didn't make and wanted to force me to pay for it. They had to pull up their video recording and saw that it wasn't me, but till today I still didn't get any apology from them.

It was funny that I was letting them know that they missed out on some things I ordered and that the bill should be more than that, and they saw that as an opportunity to charge me for something I didn't order.

This is somewhere I used to visit every other weekend with my friends, but they have the belief that losing just 1 customer wouldn't make a difference."
Delish Dining,"This was my first time here and it was a very terrible service. Placed an order for a goat head (isiewu) over the phone, only to get there after an hour and be told that the order was forgotten. Finally got the order just to find out that 3/4 of the goat head were bones of the head. Imagine seeing a full goat‚Äôs dentition both upper and lower jaw in your meal for $75. I wouldn‚Äôt go back and definitely don‚Äôt recommend üëéüèæ"
FraMe Cuisine,"Thank you to Francine and FraMe Cuisine for your amazing service and delicious food! Your hard work and attention to detail truly made our event a success, and we received many compliments from our attendees regarding the quality of the catering. We appreciate your dedication and professionalism, and we look forward to working with you again in the future. Thank you for helping to make our event unforgettable!"
FraMe Cuisine,"Today‚Äôs chicken and beef, both cooked in tomato sauce and served with long grained white rice and vegetables, were tender, tasty and I highly recommend them. Served with a smile, I think these FraMe cooks and staff really like what they‚Äôre doing."
FraMe Cuisine,"The wonderful team at Frame provided catering for my recent event and were so amazing! Communication was prompt, friendly and they were so understanding of various last minute changes I had to make. I got the cheese & crackers and fruit platters and everything was delicious, fresh and very aesthetically pleasing. I appreciated the touch of adding gluten free crackers even though I hadn‚Äôt specified that, it showed great care. Overall Francine & Mely were a joy to work with and I‚Äôm looking forward to having them cater my next event!"
FraMe Cuisine,"FraMe make the best food and it‚Äôs always served with a friendly smile. Their portions are a perfect size for this senior, and their prices keep me coming back. Thanks for coming to our community on Tuesdays and Thursdays."
FraMe Cuisine,"Customer service is amazing, Francine is incredibly helpful and her food is THE BEST!!! She delivered it, even managed to give her a hug!  Fabulous experience!!! Definitely going to return for more!!!"
FraMe Cuisine,Great service and great food  who could ask for more? The food was well presented and very tasty. There were a lot of compliments about the quality and variety of the food. Thanks FraMe.
FraMe Cuisine,Our guests had a lot of complements!
African Dine,"When it's something I've never had before, it's amazing and different! Would recommend!"
African Dine,My friends and I love coming here for lunch.
Merilyn's Kitchen,"I went there for the first time yesterday and it was amazing.

Good customer service, food preparation was fast, food was tasty and felt like home. I hope to come here again. Out of all I ate, my best is the Efo Riro. You have to try it! The Suya is really nice too.

You can also get snacks like chinchin, puff puff, meatpie, etc. The aesthetic of the place is like a typical Nigerian restaurant and I love it."
Merilyn's Kitchen,"A nice Nigerian restaurant in NE of Calgary. Food was good. Very good standard. Tasted fresh and homemade. We had Moimoi and assorted and another plate of beans and plantains. I found it slightly expensive though. Both plates cost $41. The beans and plantain jd no protein.

Also, there was bit of queue. Like people were standing for like 8-10mins before being attended to and another 10/15mins before food is ready.

Overall, I‚Äôll come again, cause food was good. Maybe i‚Äôll call to order ahead if that‚Äôs available."
Merilyn's Kitchen,Got Fufu with chicken as well as Jollof rice with tilapia and another Jollof rice with plantain and meat pies. It was all very delicious. The lady up front also gave me a free puff puff to try and that was so good! I thought they were really nice and the food was good. Maybe a bit on the expensive side for the portion sizes but worth it if you're looking for this kind of food.
Merilyn's Kitchen,"Another attempt at giving a Nigerian restaurant a chance. Service, food, atmosphere was mediocre at best. Its just disappointing.

We are new in Calgary and decided to give this place a try. We ordered the poundo yam & okra (see pic of the okra), rice & ofada, and pepper soup. On arrival, there was no one at the register and we had to wait about 10minutes & it took my partner hollering and waving to get a response. I specifically asked if the ofada was the green or the red one of which the lady that attended to me answered that it was green. Lo and behold it looked more like red pepper stew. The Okra was the one that we thought was pretty poor. From what i know, okra was a ‚Äòdraw‚Äô soup but what we were served was surely not Okra. I made this known to the lady that served us that I was surprised by this. I took a couple of scoops to feed myself and my 22month old but could no longer take it. I brought it to the attention of the ladies (1 who i believe is the owner). Her response was ‚Äòso what should i do, what should i do?). To avoid confrontation, i requested to just have the assorted meat and we were ready to leave. I asked for egusi soup instead and guess she had a change of heart and provided the egusi as an exchange. This was gracious on her part. The egusi was a bit better. But i could clearly hear the owner grumbling and speaking in the kitchen about me/ the incident. The other lady said I should have ordered ogbono if I wanted draw soup. Welp! It seemed like a joke to be honest. Its just sad that as much as we try to support our own, we are met with so much disappointment and poor service. Our Nigerian food is very expensive and wished we got more value and better experience out of it. Will not be returning. Order the Okra at your own risk!"
Merilyn's Kitchen,"Extremely rude!! my friend went in to get food and the old lady yelled at her for asking for the food she called ahead to order. My friend   needed her food quick which is why she called ahead but the food was still not ready when she got to the restaurant, when she asked for her food the older lady at the back began yelling at her. It‚Äôs a shame, and this is not the first time they have been extremely rude to me or someone I know. It is horrible because being rude is what your restaurant is known forü§Æ"
Merilyn's Kitchen,"I paid for my rice & fish, I asked her where a barber shop was & she said it‚Äôs a few blocks away.
I went to the barbers & came back to inform her I was cutting my hair. The signage clearly states she closes @ 9pm.
I got here just before 9pm & she‚Äôs gone. Very annoying."
Merilyn's Kitchen,"Called to place an order and got rudely interrupted when I asked about puff puff. I understand they don‚Äôt pre-order puff puff but I was literally asking to ensure they even had puff puff; so they need to figure that out. I also had the phone hung up on me mid order, for no reason. I will not be going back here again due to such treatment."
Luubann East African Restaurant,"Had a chicken suqaar. Was okay but not tasteful as I thought. The service was very poor. Had to wait even to place the order. Didn‚Äôt bring water or asked about it so had to request. And only gave one glass of water and took back the water jar. Place was not very clean. Saw a few flies too. Not attentive to the customers. The lady was always on phone. And I asked if they have any desserts, and said no."
Luubann East African Restaurant,"Nothing fancy, just super delicious food.  We had the goat soup and the lamb entree.  The food was well prepared, presented and packed with delightful flavours.  The service was good with an easy-going and friendly atmosphere.  We will definitely be back to try the many other different entrees.  Highly recommended."
Luubann East African Restaurant,"A lovely hole-in-the-wall restaurant that I am very glad to have been introduced to!! The food was excellent, portions were fair as well as prices, service was prompt, and overall I had zero complaints. Very highly recommend this place for anyone seeking authentic and delicious East African food!!

P.S.: The shaah is to die for!!"
Luubann East African Restaurant,"Don't judge a book by its cover.

This little Somali Restaurant lured me because I was traveling with my friend who has a limited diet...but goat is on her allowed foods list. We have eaten at numerous East African restaurants in Edmonton but were traveling through Calgary and needed to find a similar restaurant.

On the surface, Luubann is not in an ideal neighborhood and parking is hard to find. It is such a little unassuming dining establishment that one might think it's not worth a stop.  And it's certainly not a fancy place.

We would not have normally stopped there if it wasn't because of the diet of my friend. But I am so glad we did.  The lady at the front was so kind and sweet.  We ordered a goat and a beef and we were thrilled. And to top it all off, she brought us two soups for free.

I am so glad to share this review and the five stars. We'll be back."
Luubann East African Restaurant,"Went for lunch today, was the absolute best Somali food I've had. Was authentic homestyle Somali cooking. Definitely worth more than a 5 star review."
Luubann East African Restaurant,"Good food my only problem is my goat meat was substituted for lamb without my knowledge or consent! But the owner was nice enough to make me another goat plate free of charge, and let me say that was so tasty and well prepared"
Luubann East African Restaurant,"was my first time with my daughter and  we found it so good. The food was excellent, the owners were really nice, and love the soup! Congrats!!!!"
