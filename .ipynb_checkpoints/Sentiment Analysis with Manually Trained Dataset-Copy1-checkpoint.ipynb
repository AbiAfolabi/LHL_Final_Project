       "      <td>I have been a long time customer of this store and have always had great experience. However, recently, with the change in staffing my experiences has been less than pleasant. Today, I attended to do my regular shopping as usual and noticed that their prices has increase drastically. I was buying this items for my mom, who is not in Calgary. I bought a pepper, even though there was no price anywhere the item was located. It occurred to me after leaving the store to check with my mom whether or not she would be fine with the 10 dollar price on such a small amount of pepper. She said not to buy it and to return it. I returned to the store less than 5 minutes later only for them to be telling me that they are not doing returns due to covid 19. Which is understandable. However, this needs to be made aware to all customers when arriving at the door not behind your counter where no one ever thought to look. further, there is nothing preventing your store associates  mention that to every customers to further reinforce that information. After the store associate realized that I was going to stay there as long as it takes for her to refund my money, she did. This experience left a bad taste in my mouth and would like to see improvement.</td>\n",

       "4  I have been a long time customer of this store and have always had great experience. However, recently, with the change in staffing my experiences has been less than pleasant. Today, I attended to do my regular shopping as usual and noticed that their prices has increase drastically. I was buying this items for my mom, who is not in Calgary. I bought a pepper, even though there was no price anywhere the item was located. It occurred to me after leaving the store to check with my mom whether or not she would be fine with the 10 dollar price on such a small amount of pepper. She said not to buy it and to return it. I returned to the store less than 5 minutes later only for them to be telling me that they are not doing returns due to covid 19. Which is understandable. However, this needs to be made aware to all customers when arriving at the door not behind your counter where no one ever thought to look. further, there is nothing preventing your store associates  mention that to every customers to further reinforce that information. After the store associate realized that I was going to stay there as long as it takes for her to refund my money, she did. This experience left a bad taste in my mouth and would like to see improvement.   \n",

So what gives them the right to tell me about handling?\\n\\nThis is a store I have seen expired palm oils on the shelf severally but the store owner had the audacity to preach to me about food handling.

I bought a pepper, even though there was no price anywhere the item was located. It occurred to me after leaving the store to check with my mom whether or not she would be fine with the 10 dollar price on such a small amount of pepper. She said not to buy it and to return it.

       "4  I have been a long time customer of this store and have always had great experience. However, recently, with the change in staffing my experiences has been less than pleasant. Today, I attended to do my regular shopping as usual and noticed that their prices has increase drastically. I was buying this items for my mom, who is not in Calgary. I bought a pepper, even though there was no price anywhere the item was located. It occurred to me after leaving the store to check with my mom whether or not she would be fine with the 10 dollar price on such a small amount of pepper. She said not to buy it and to return it. I returned to the store less than 5 minutes later only for them to be telling me that they are not doing returns due to covid 19. Which is understandable. However, this needs to be made aware to all customers when arriving at the door not behind your counter where no one ever thought to look. further, there is nothing preventing your store associates  mention that to every customers to further reinforce that information. After the store associate realized that I was going to stay there as long as it takes for her to refund my money, she did. This experience left a bad taste in my mouth and would like to see improvement.   \n",

       "4  I have been a long time customer of this store and have always had great experience However recently with the change in staffing my experiences has been less than pleasant Today I attended to do my regular shopping as usual and noticed that their prices has increase drastically I was buying this items for my mom who is not in Calgary I bought a pepper even though there was no price anywhere the item was located It occurred to me after leaving the store to check with my mom whether or not she would be fine with the 10 dollar price on such a small amount of pepper She said not to buy it and to return it I returned to the store less than 5 minutes later only for them to be telling me that they are not doing returns due to covid 19 Which is understandable However this needs to be made aware to all customers when arriving at the door not behind your counter where no one ever thought to look further there is nothing preventing your store associates  mention that to every customers to further reinforce that information After the store associate realized that I was going to stay there as long as it takes for her to refund my money she did This experience left a bad taste in my mouth and would like to see improvement   \n",

       "4  I have been a long time customer of this store and have always had great experience. However, recently, with the change in staffing my experiences has been less than pleasant. Today, I attended to do my regular shopping as usual and noticed that their prices has increase drastically. I was buying this items for my mom, who is not in Calgary. I bought a pepper, even though there was no price anywhere the item was located. It occurred to me after leaving the store to check with my mom whether or not she would be fine with the 10 dollar price on such a small amount of pepper. She said not to buy it and to return it. I returned to the store less than 5 minutes later only for them to be telling me that they are not doing returns due to covid 19. Which is understandable. However, this needs to be made aware to all customers when arriving at the door not behind your counter where no one ever thought to look. further, there is nothing preventing your store associates  mention that to every customers to further reinforce that information. After the store associate realized that I was going to stay there as long as it takes for her to refund my money, she did. This experience left a bad taste in my mouth and would like to see improvement.   \n",
