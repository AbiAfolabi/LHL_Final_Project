The owner of the store told me I wouldn‚Äôt get a refund due to ‚Äúso called food handling‚Äù. This was a dry product in its original packaging and unopened. The product had no expiry date on the package when I bought it, the receipt had no return policy whatsoever. So what gives them the right to tell me about handling?

This is a store I have seen expired palm oils on the shelf severally but the store owner had the audacity to preach to me about food handling. I want to point out the double standard and hypocrisy.

However, recently, with the change in staffing my experiences has been less than pleasant. Today, I attended to do my regular shopping as usual and noticed that their prices has increase drastically. I was buying this items for my mom, who is not in Calgary. I bought a pepper, even though there was no price anywhere the item was located. It occurred to me after leaving the store to check with my mom whether or not she would be fine with the 10 dollar price on such a small amount of pepper. She said not to buy it and to return it. I returned to the store less than 5 minutes later only for them to be telling me that they are not doing returns due to covid 19. Which is understandable. However, this needs to be made aware to all customers when arriving at the door not behind your counter where no one ever thought to look. further, there is nothing preventing your store associates  mention that to every customers to further reinforce that information. After the store associate realized that I was going to stay there as long as it takes for her to refund my money, she did.

Honestly so disappointed in this store.
I have been cheated more than twice and most times they claim its a mistake. They knowingly cheat you and add to the bills you have and when you find out, they claim its a mistake.
The first time this happened to me, i thought it was actually an error on their part but when it kept repeating itself, i knew they were aware of what they were doing.
please make sure to check your receipts properly when you buy things from this store and most importantly look at the price before you go to the counter so they don't add to it, as they are fond of doing this.

EDIT:

They now have a pos system which issues receipts and more transparent system, hence I have come back to edit review.",4.0,06/29/2023 14:28:19

I went to the location to purchase a new Andis T professional beard and hair trimmer.  Originally the location had 2 in stock when i went in to purchase the razor and i chose the first box on display.  After leaving with my purchase, I hadn't considered opening the box to check the product until i reached my next destination and thats when i realized the razor was used, rusted and broken.  I returned to the location right away to ask for an exchange as the product i purchased was damaged and clearly well used.  Instead of agreeing to an exchange, the employee refused and stated that i should have opened the box before leaving the store and that she actually believed i had taken the ""newly"" purchased razor and replaced it with my own used and broken razor... in that case, why would i have asked for an exchange.  When she refused to exchange the damaged product, i then asked for a refund which she then told me she was not authorized to give and that i would need to speak with the owner who was conveniently not at the location and could not be reached at that time.

This is an ongoing scam in Africa and after speaking with the owner the next day, she told me that she needed a week to investigate what may have happened.  These locations provide African food and products and ive seen these razors sitting on the shelf collecting dust, i chose to purchase the pruduct so i could support a black owned small business when i could have easily purchased the razor from Amazon.  I left the damaged and used razor with them and gave up on getting any money returned to me, i really just want others to be weary and aware that it may happen to them as well.",1.0,05/12/2023 16:59:05

We are new in Calgary and decided to give this place a try. We ordered the poundo yam & okra (see pic of the okra), rice & ofada, and pepper soup. On arrival, there was no one at the register and we had to wait about 10minutes & it took my partner hollering and waving to get a response. I specifically asked if the ofada was the green or the red one of which the lady that attended to me answered that it was green. Lo and behold it looked more like red pepper stew. The Okra was the one that we thought was pretty poor. From what i know, okra was a ‚Äòdraw‚Äô soup but what we were served was surely not Okra. I made this known to the lady that served us that I was surprised by this. I took a couple of scoops to feed myself and my 22month old but could no longer take it. I brought it to the attention of the ladies (1 who i believe is the owner). Her response was ‚Äòso what should i do, what should i do?). To avoid confrontation, i requested to just have the assorted meat and we were ready to leave. I asked for egusi soup instead and guess she had a change of heart and provided the egusi as an exchange. This was gracious on her part. The egusi was a bit better. But i could clearly hear the owner grumbling and speaking in the kitchen about me/ the incident. The other lady said I should have ordered ogbono if I wanted draw soup. Welp! It seemed like a joke to be honest. Its just sad that as much as we try to support our own, we are met with so much disappointment and poor service.

This little Somali Restaurant lured me because I was traveling with my friend who has a limited diet...but goat is on her allowed foods list. We have eaten at numerous East African restaurants in Edmonton but were traveling through Calgary and needed to find a similar restaurant.

On the surface, Luubann is not in an ideal neighborhood and parking is hard to find. It is such a little unassuming dining establishment that one might think it's not worth a stop.  And it's certainly not a fancy place.

We would not have normally stopped there if it wasn't because of the diet of my friend. But I am so glad we did.  The lady at the front was so kind and sweet.  We ordered a goat and a beef and we were thrilled. And to top it all off, she brought us two soups for free.
