10,Calgary,African Choice Market,93,4.2,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURjOEthWFlBEAE,"I have been a long time customer of this store and have always had great experience. However, recently, with the change in staffing my experiences has been less than pleasant. Today, I attended to do my regular shopping as usual and noticed that their prices has increase drastically. I was buying this items for my mom, who is not in Calgary. I bought a pepper, even though there was no price anywhere the item was located. It occurred to me after leaving the store to check with my mom whether or not she would be fine with the 10 dollar price on such a small amount of pepper. She said not to buy it and to return it. I returned to the store less than 5 minutes later only for them to be telling me that they are not doing returns due to covid 19. Which is understandable. However, this needs to be made aware to all customers when arriving at the door not behind your counter where no one ever thought to look. further, there is nothing preventing your store associates  mention that to every customers to further reinforce that information. After the store associate realized that I was going to stay there as long as it takes for her to refund my money, she did. This experience left a bad taste in my mouth and would like to see improvement.",1,5/17/2020 0:19

The comment below about $10 pepper lol me too my bf bought it and later told me the price, I screamed! African stores always have no refund policies (what is that aboutüôÑ) They lied about Covid reason and plus the peppers are in the package. if superstore would take something I touched back, why can‚Äôt they?

30,Calgary,Sage Meadows Market African Store,58,4.2,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPbWFUdmVBEAE,"BEWARE!
Honestly so disappointed in this store.
I have been cheated more than twice and most times they claim its a mistake. They knowingly cheat you and add to the bills you have and when you find out, they claim its a mistake.
The first time this happened to me, i thought it was actually an error on their part but when it kept repeating itself, i knew they were aware of what they were doing.
please make sure to check your receipts properly when you buy things from this store and most importantly look at the price before you go to the counter so they don't add to it, as they are fond of doing this.

EDIT:

They now have a pos system which issues receipts and more transparent system, hence I have come back to edit review.",4,6/29/2023 14:28

62,Calgary,De Chosen African Market,121,4.3,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4bkpycElBEAE,"****BEWARE OF SCAMMERS****

I went to the location to purchase a new Andis T professional beard and hair trimmer.  Originally the location had 2 in stock when i went in to purchase the razor and i chose the first box on display.  After leaving with my purchase, I hadn't considered opening the box to check the product until i reached my next destination and thats when i realized the razor was used, rusted and broken.  I returned to the location right away to ask for an exchange as the product i purchased was damaged and clearly well used.  Instead of agreeing to an exchange, the employee refused and stated that i should have opened the box before leaving the store and that she actually believed i had taken the ""newly"" purchased razor and replaced it with my own used and broken razor... in that case, why would i have asked for an exchange.  When she refused to exchange the damaged product, i then asked for a refund which she then told me she was not authorized to give and that i would need to speak with the owner who was conveniently not at the location and could not be reached at that time.

This is an ongoing scam in Africa and after speaking with the owner the next day, she told me that she needed a week to investigate what may have happened.  These locations provide African food and products and ive seen these razors sitting on the shelf collecting dust, i chose to purchase the pruduct so i could support a black owned small business when i could have easily purchased the razor from Amazon.  I left the damaged and used razor with them and gave up on getting any money returned to me, i really just want others to be weary and aware that it may happen to them as well.",1,5/12/2023 16:59

The layout and interior was just a wee bit nicer than the standard Nigerian restaurant look or aesthetic.
The lady who attended to us looked tired but she was smiling through it and that is huge to me. I could eat and enjoy my food without a smile but the effort meant or means a whole lot in my opinion.
The washroom was really clean.
The water for rinsing/washing our hands was nice and warm. Little things like that count.
NOW THE KOKO (main thing). The nkwobi was BOMB. Not bones funny muscle-y meat‚Ä¶nice good sized meat and delicious!
I had Afang and that was really good too (you can see that I didn‚Äôt remember to take pictures‚Ä¶ e get why üòÑ). We got the grilled tilapia to go and feedback we got is that it was really nice. I will definitely be visiting again. Oh! And wait time was not bad at all.

It is worth your money, time and effort shopping at Africart  located in  Bonnie Doon mall.

Provenance is an artwork's history of ownership. Information about the provenance of an individual work of art sheds light on its historical, social, and economic context as well as its critical fortunes through time.Creative thinkers and makers provide their communities with joy, interaction, and inspiration, but they also give thoughtful critique to our political, economic, and social systems ¬ó pushing communities to engage thoughtfully and make steps toward social progress.-This truth--is from an article. We society need to shop creatively to buy art work from shops like Africart where we get valuable information, quality service and our money's worth of priceless items. Art cannot be measured by its price but measured as follows: Art reflects cultural values, beliefs and identity and helps to preserve the many different communities that make up our world.

The elderly couple that own the restaurant is adorable, they are very accommodating and kind. The food is clearly home cooked and perfectly spicy (for my liking)! Truly worth a detour or two ??",5,6/1/2023 23:33
503,Airdrie,East Africa Restaurant,333,4.4,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURPajhtX0NBEAE,"My favorite Ethiopian restaurant in Montreal. They make homemade traditional Ethiopian food, the dishes are served in a large plate, ideal to share with friends or family!

Prices are very fair for the amount of food and the quality, much more so than other Ethiopian cuisine restaurant in the city.

I suggest looking up the menu on the website and making a reservation and ordering ahead of time so that they can start preparing the food ahead of time. These dishes are full of flavour and spices and require time to prepare and simmer.
It can take some time for the food to arrive, sometimes over an hour but you expect it and know it is worth the reward at the end!

I'm so happy to have found this restaurant, my family and I always leave with a full belly and a huge smile!",5,7/17/2022 0:39

I went there with a friend and we were the first people to order and it was a bit late and I wondered why they took so long but when I looked only to find out that they seem to prepare the food once they open which is the best thing to do and I really admired it and I didn¬ít mind that it took a while, and after testing the food it was worth waiting it was delicious, the enjera ( bread) the sauce everything was sooo perfect. And their service was great I didn¬ít get his name there was a nice man with a lady.

We ordered the two lamb dishes and the Mixed vegetarian and it was So GOOD! There are not many places I would comfortably recommend, but this one is definitely where it's at. I can't speak for authenticity but it is absolutely delicious! And the injera is so soft and Fluffy and so easy to digest! Because it is run by only two people, it can take some time for your food to come out (I believe it was around 30 minutes) because I believe they make every dish to order. But it is so worth it! Just to keep in mind that they do not serve alcohol so bring your own wine if you want to drink! I hope you can give this place a chance!",5,2/19/2023 22:10

512,Airdrie,East Africa Restaurant,333,4.4,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQybm9DdnpRRRAB,"My fianc√© and I are literally addicted to this place. We go every two weeks to get our Ethiopian fix.

Dining here literally feels like you're dining at a family members house; they are beyond welcoming, make us feel comfortable, and prepare their meals with love and passion that you can taste.

The restaurants ambience is very low-key, nestled along the Sherbrooke strip in the heart of NDG. There are several occasions when they sometimes don't have what we'd like on the menu, as they're a very small operation, and I can only assume that materials run out fast, especially given how tasty things are, but they always make up for it by making us custom dishes and sides for us, which we always love.

We have a running gag about going - ""they're not going to serve you what you want, but what you need"" - and this motto, the quality of their food, and the fact that it feels like eating with family makes us come back religiously every two weeks to have their amazing food.

We have been to several Ethipoian restaurants across Canada, and this is the only place that we consistently go out of our way to go to on a consistent basis; it's not sophisticated, has modern seating, etc, but it doesn't need those things, because the food is that good.

Something to note however that other reviewers have mentioned as well; you need patience to eat here. All the food and dishes are made to order, and sometimes it can take quiet long to come out, but trust me, it's worth it. In addition, the fact that two grown adults can eat handsomely for 30$, including a tip, seems like a dying phenomena right now. For the cost alone this place is incredible.

I'd you're reading this are you haven't already made your way to their restaurant and gotten a dual order of 18 and 20/21, this review hasn't done their rest enough justice! Go support a small local business, and enjoy!

FYI - they also accommodate BYOW as well, so if you're so inclined to pair the injera with a nice bottle of wine, that's a nice option as well!

Enjoy!",5,5/15/2022 15:59

523,Airdrie,East Africa Restaurant,333,4.4,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURnM0pDTlFBEAE,"As is their culture's custom, there are no utensils.
You use the crepe the food is sitting on, to pinch a portion of food, and then try and get it to your mouth, before having it fall into your lap. ;(
We chose veggies with chicken and beef.

Best seat in the house is the window seat.
Very small, with some atmosphere.
Food took time, but, was worth the wait.
However....***
1. I think cutting the rolled crepe into smaller manageable portions and not having to tear uneven rolls would help. At least for me.
2. If you are using hands, then perhaps a bowl of hot water or wet naps and definitely more napkins would help solve that. ""We were assigned one napkin each.""
3. Water only.... so bring you own drinks.
4. Where menu?  The Menu is on the wall... so I photographed it and attached it here somewhere.  Be advised, French only.
5. There is a washroom downstairs. Should be updated.
6. I guess you could always ask for a fork and knife.
However...
I am still rating it high-ish, only,  only because of the quality of the food and the novelty of the whole experience. All in all, - Very much fun. ...and good luck getting the window seat!",4,8/11/2018 14:29

Come with patience as the cook makes everything to order and the wait could be a long one if 9 people suddenly arrive all at the same time. It's a bring-your-own-wine so when you have wine and good company, the wait is easily forgettable especially once the delicious food finally arrives.

We found the portions much too small for the price, as it seems they will fit everything onto one plate, no matter how many dishes you order. So the more you order, the smaller each portion seems to get. We had to reorder because we were not even close to being full with our initial order. Dinner for 4 was $185 plus tip (no drinks, no side dishes), which is the type of pricing you expect from a much fancier restaurant than this simple, out-of-downtown venue.

793,Edmonton,Bete Africa Ethiopian Restaurant and Bar,222,4.7,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2anFYMmxnRRAB,"This place is absolutely fantastic. The service is so kind. If you love Ethiopian food, you will not be disappointed. The serving sizes are big, if you see a big price, that's because you will be feeding alot of people. Ask about serving sizes of you aren't sure, the staff are happy to talk to you. When we came here with our family it was my first restaurant experience out of the hospital and it was so warm and inviting.

If you love meat usually and are disappointed by the amount of veggies on the menu, trust me, these veggies pack so much flavor you will not be missing the meat and this is coming from someone who almost always has to correct that thought in my head when eating Ethiopian. Don't be scared of the veggie stews. It's not by any means a side of steamed veggies beside your lamb. No no no. You will very likely prefer these veggie stews over the meats. Not to say the meats are bad, they're just very filling, and you will want to eat and share with your party and finish your plater while having a good time, veggie stew options sit a little nicer for that and the meat can be a nice little treat.

You can order as much of the bread as you would like. Don't stress take your time, share.

I definitely recommend the coffee afterwards. It's a thick Ethiopian coffee that they roast in house and we felt so lucky to see our (it honestly feels deminutive to call her a waitress since she was so involved) roast the beans from green, bring out the grounds, tell us about the origins of even the coffee set.

She asked us if we were sensitive to scent and if we would like some incense that helps settle the stomach. I really appreciate this because I am sensitive to some scents but traditional incense, unless it involves pine or cedar, is fine with me (as far as I know) so we had coffee and smelled the incense as our (Barista/waitress/historian) puts up with me trying to pin down what kind of incense it is because it smells so nice.

She saw I was making an effort and she gave me some. It was an incredible evening and we had leftovers to share. I hope you do well with your business and you live up to your name.",5,9/29/2021 15:13

796,Edmonton,Bete Africa Ethiopian Restaurant and Bar,222,4.7,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURRX1lMc0RnEAE,"***AMAZING food, slower service***

The food we had at Bete Africa was incredibly delicious; hands-down some of the best Ethiopian food in Edmonton.  The decor was beautiful, and the owners were very pleasant, and offered lots of advice, since a couple people in our group of 6 had never had Ethiopian food before; My one issue was that our food took nearly an hour to arrive, to the point we were about to ask for it to just be packed up for takeaway, they brought it to the table.  Drink orders took a while as well.

Everything was delicious!  We ordered the All-in-One Special (which might be why things took so long, but a heads-up would have been helpful when we ordered).  This is a huge combo platter with a little bit of everything and LOTS of injera.  We came fairly close to crushing it between the 6 of us, but it easily could feed 8-10 people.  It was also INCREDIBLY affordable, coming to $20 each, including tip.

I can't even begin to express how delicious this food is, but if you're coming here during the week for lunch, maybe book some extra time beyond an hour to account for service.  I definitely will recommend this to others, and will be back myself, but will make sure it's on a day I'm not in a hurry.

Thank you so much for a wonderful experience. I will definitely be back!",5,9/13/2018 16:38

925,Edmonton,Rayyan Restaurant,495,4.9,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2bUwzWlFBEAE,"This was my first time trying Somali/Kenyan food.

We were greeted by the host and seated right away. The host brought us soups (on the house) and the menus. He then left and came back with 3 jugs (2 juices and 1 water - again, on the house) and asked if we had any questions. They were very accommodating in explaining what each item on the menu was.

We ordered chicken mashkaki, salmon, lamb shank, tilapia, and sides of bread, rice, and vegetables. The food quality was great, there was a good amount of flavour and the spices were not over done. For dessert, we had ice cream and tea. The tea was a bit sweet for our taste as we enjoy black tea.

While eating, the owner came out and made sure we were satisfied. He also shared his backstory which was refreshing to hear about. Overall, the service and their hospitality were great.

As for pricing, we were very surprised to see a $66 bill for 4 people dining out with a complete meal. You can¬ít find fast food for that kind of price that we enjoyed so much food for.

5/5 would recommend this place.",5,9/20/2021 1:59

Also, as an additional side, you are given the option of a  jug of lemon or mango juice, as well as fruit, in my case a well ripened tasty banana. It also had a specially prepared hot sauce for individual liking. Moreover, it has free  three hours street parking right in front of the restaurant or on any street in the neighborhood.

Food was delicious, we ordered barbeque chicken with rice as well as the beef muscle with rice. These also came with the delicious chicken soup which they served as soon as we sat down. It was definitely way more than we could finish and our server gave us some complementary chapati bread which was very delicious. I really really liked their spicy green hot sauce which they gave me extra to take home lol. They also brought us a mango cheesecake with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and another type of cake for my husband with some ice cream which was also very nice and generous of them and it was very delicious. What a very great time and experience and highly recommend to anyone to try.",5,3/23/2022 4:48

Very good food, plenty of beverages, and if you ask nicely, they have a special cheesecake banana dessert which you can't buy anywhere else. My top favorite entrees are the lamb shank, the breaded sugar chicken, and the salmon. The rice is very flavorful, and I liked the spaghetti too. I go out once in a while for very nice food. But what makes Rayyan special is that it's the any occasion restaurant. It's affordable to go every day, and has a nice area for more formal occasions. I've held family dinners here with my grandma and uncle's family. And I've also brought co-workers and managers.

He showed me the menu and I picked out some grilled beef with some rice and mixed vegetables. He offered me a seat to wait for my order so I obliged. He brought me out a complimentary bowl of soup that was delicious. What a nice thing to do. My food was ready in ten minutes. I paid my bill and he inquired in a really welcoming way how I had heard of the restaurant so I told him it was just by chance. He spoke to me in a way that made me feel really welcomed at the restaurant. I got home and had the food and it was awesome. The rice was perfect and the beef and vegetables came in a nice gravy that mixed with the rice was just the kind of home cooked taste that I needed in my food.

1043,Edmonton,Rayyan Restaurant,495,4.9,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURHaDZEbkp3EAE,"Having been kept by Covid from eating out as we used to, my wife and I got to do a lot of home cooking. We pretty much cut out going to restaurants. Because of that we became really picky the few times we went to a restaurant, or we bought take-out from one. We didn¬ít want to eat in, or have take-out from, a so-so restaurant the few time we did either. One place, out of the very few, that has become our go-to restaurant for take-out, is Rayyan Restaurant, which is located in downtown Edmonton on 106 Avenue, just off 101 Street. The restaurant caters mostly Somali food. We¬íre not new to restaurant Somali food. We used to help ourselves to it a lot but went off it for quite sometime. Then, not too too long ago, we happened to be driving along 101 Street across 106 Avenue when we spotted Rayyan Restaurant, which describes itself as serving ¬ìEast African food.¬î We said, ¬ìA new East African restaurant. I bet they serve Somali food. Let¬ís try it out!¬î We did and found the food to be better than much other Somali food we had had in the past ¬ó a variety of tasty, dishes in big portions served in a fast but friendly and professional manner. The owner, Noor, is engaging with a welcoming smile. He keeps a hands-on involvement on various tasks in the restaurants but still finds time for brief pleasant exchanges with customers. The restaurant operates 7 am to 10 pm, which means they must have lots of customers to be confident enough to be open for so many hours daily. Their confidence must come from their good food. We have tried mostly camel, lamb (shoulder and shank), beef, flavored rice and spaghetti, and chapati (flat bread); and all those dishes have been sumptuous. Rayyan also serves goat and chicken, which we haven¬ít try but plan to. They also serve breakfast, which we haven¬ít tried but we may just one day, out of curiosity. All in all, Rayyan is a Somali food restaurant I would recommend without hesitation to any one with a love for or curious about African food. Rayyan may be an excellent place for one to begin their African culinary journey.",5,12/12/2021 3:00

The shiro wot (chickpea stew) came out piping hot in a bowl and it had a savoury but sweet flavour. It¬ís hard to explain but absolutely delicious.

The dishes were so fantastically prepared, and this is coming from someone who is not only particular about food being well prepared, but one who cooks too! The portions were delightfully generous, we were certain we would have several packs of food to go home with, but the food was way too tasty that we struggled to go home with barely anything!

I previously purchased a box of chicken which wasn't cut the way I would like them cut and ever since I have my own reservation and would like them cut right in front of me. On this day, the guy refused and was adamant that I either take the pre-cut chicken or nothing, I tried to be understanding by telling him to show me a piece and then I would decide if I'm okay with it and he said I can open the box myself and check it if I like. I found this so disrespectful! He was actually getting into a heated argument with me and I thought it's best I leave the store.

He is rude every-time and I can¬ít stand there to exchange words with him only Cos he¬ís an elderly man, i hope he works on his ego issues this year Cos he is definitely doing a kind of job that humbles people but he¬ís out there trying to show/prove himself to people when they¬íre not even looking down on him in the first place, if he cannot do the job just give the opportunity to someone else.

If I may suggest,  acknowledge your customers, having a store in Canada means you are serving customers who are Nigerians and non Nigerians. You are not the only African store in Scarborough. People have options and would like to support you but when you don't acknowledge customers,  you keep them waiting like they have nothing to  do with their time then expect no one to support you.
All I ask is that you do better with your customer service because you do have a lot of potential as a business.  Also with the renovations going on in your store try to keep it tidy. It's a mess and a health and safety hazard.
I also understand that it's a husband and wife that own the store, but this is where as business owners you hire a staff to help customers or multitask.  When I'm going home after a long day at work, I want to quickly grab the few things that I need,  pay and go home.  I don't want to stand there for 20minutes, not being acknowledged or cared for.

The meat was the softest we have ever had at any restaurant anywhere. The value for the price is mind-blowing. I would have paid double the price for my meal easily.
The young lady who took our order spoke English quite well, which was honestly somewhat unexpected. I can imagine that most of the regular clientele is not Anglophone, so the effort on her part was greatly appreciated by both of us.
What this place lacks in atmosphere(it is the definition of a hole in the wall, imo) is more than made up for by the food, but their dinnerware and presentation is also lovely. We will be back, probably with friends. These ladies really deserve more business!",5,5/29/2017 0:02

The salad that came was ok but obviously a bagged salad. Totally unnecessary in my opinion! This food shines ethnically and doesn't need to be ""westernized"" with a salad to make it big in the food industry in Edmonton. Keep up the good hosting too.

The last five times I've gone in have been horrible, and I won't be returning.

The soup and juice being complimentary items is similar to other African restaurants that I have been to, but it¬ís still a nice surprise. All the food tasted really good. The soup had a lot of spice and flavour and I had multiple bowls. The juice and samosa were quite nice as well.

They offer Somali cuisine in a casual, 'Mom's Kitchen' kind of atmosphere. Cutlery is optional here. If you've enjoyed casual African food before though, you won't be surprised by that. If you're put-off by this kind of casual experience you'll be missing an amazing meal but, at least you'll be leaving seats open for the rest of us.

I had the lamb and rice, and I have to say, it was one of the best meals I've had in a long time. The flavours were well balanced and the portion size was generous. Service was quick and plenty of Mango juice and tea were on hand too, of course.

African food is best served spicy but Zuhur caters to sensitive taste buds too. For those who prefer milder dishes, they can feed you as well. If you like spice as much as I do though, grab an extra shot of hot sauce, that stuff is awesome

I can cheerfully recommend Zuhur Restaurant to anyone looking for a delicious and satisfying meal.

The soup is not good, and the salads are alright, I wouldn't order them if I had to pay separately for these two items.
This place was a value proposition for the rice and goat meat at $13 a year before, now costs $17 plus charges if you use a debit card. Given its location, the small portions of goat meat, this is not a value proposition anymore, one feels like we are paying 10$ for the large portion of rice.

I decided to give them another chance to support my community, but what a disappointment. These guys continue to show how they are the biggest liars, who lie to their own Somali community. I ordered off skip and had left a note for the food to be well done, and that the order was sloppy, old and stale. The owner ends up calling me and asks me what I didn¬ít like about the food. I literally just wrote it down in the notes, but your going to call me back with attitude and question me about my note I had left. Who intimidates their customers like this, so you do not want feedback? They then had the audacity to say they delivered my food when they did not. I then contacted skip to tell them about my missing delivery, the driver continued to lie and say he delivered right to my hands. This is a complete lie and a complete waste of my time and money. They have the worst food ever. If your looking for good Somali food, I would look else where. They will steal your money and not deliver food. They are rude, restaurant is dirty, food is old.

Pros
Friendly staff
24 hrs
A friend can share your pass when you aren't there.
Black Card gives you
Free Hydro massage
Free Tanning
Free Massage chair
Access to other Fit4Life
Open house last Thurs of every month for friends and family.

Cons
Planet Fitness has same Black Card perks
No Wifi
No plugs for your phone

They care less about the members and basically Allow their friends to use the gym. While members pay. I called and canceled my membership after one day use. I canceled because of my observation and my needs for a gym was not met.  Previously I had a GoodLife membership but due to Covid the pool was closed so I thought ok I will use fitforless until Covid goes away. Fitforless says I can call and cancel. So I did. To this day April first my account was charged again. Today I am going to my bank to settle this. This place is a mess and people should really find a better gym. The staff there are horrible!!!!! Bad customer service and friends being allowed in without paying as everyone does is so wrong. I even overheard a young man asking to be let in without his proof of vaccination. When told no he told the service rep that his other colleague allows him to use the gym. Sighhhhhh!!!!! Bad experience,1,4/2/2022 12:08

Honestly the biggest gym and the only location to have a water fountain compared to other locations. The staff are pretty awesome, they will happily give you a bandage when you cut yourself. There's a multitude of equipment to use from. The highest dumbbells are 75lbs and the highest small barbells are 110lbs. Weekdays it gets hella packed during the evenings at around 5-7pm but if you have a partner, you can superset machines no problem. I haven't had an issue with deadlifting heavyweights so I'm going to assume that it's fine.
Just remember we are all here to be the strongest version of ourselves. If you need a spotter, ask the guy next to you, he'd be happy to help. Focus on form, breathe, stay consistent. Unleash that killer instinct.",5,9/30/2018 3:12
